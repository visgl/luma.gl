# @unfoldedinc/react

> TODO - this is a conceptual module for now, to help us sketch out ideas.

This module contains React Components (JavaScript/JSX) to help create web apps accessing the public analytics API for Unfolded, Inc. This API is mainly intended for client-side use (in the browser) and not under Node.js (although isomorphic React applications are supported).
