Polyfilling and shader composition utilities, for example, can be used while programming directly with the WebGL API, while resource management utilities provide higher-level 3D engine functionality.\n\nThe core use case for luma.gl is visualization of large datasets, but its design is generic enough for more general usage. Key strengths of luma.gl include:\n\n- **A WebGL 2-first API** - luma.gl polyfills WebGL 1 contexts insofar as possible to support the WebGL 2 API. This allows applications to code using the latest WebGL2 APIs while transparently keeping the application backwards compatible with WebGL1 (using WebGL extensions, shader transpilation and other techniques).\n- **Modular, Composable Tools** - It is left to the develop to decide what parts of luma.gl suit their application. Program at a higher level using WebGL wrapper classes or a `Model`, or simply polyfill the context and program using the WebGL 2 API.\n- **High-performance Data Visualization** - luma.gl focuses on simplifying access to APIs that are particularly useful when visualizing large data sets, such as instanced drawing and transform feedback.\n\nFor some powerful examples of what can be achieved with luma.gl, take a look at [deck.gl](http://deck.gl/#/), [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) and [avs.auto](https://avs.auto/#/).\n\n## Future\n\nWe share information about the direction of luma.gl in the following ways:\n\n* **[RFCs](https://github.com/uber/luma.gl/tree/7.3-release/dev-docs/RFCs)** - RFCs are technical writeups that describe proposed features in upcoming releases.\n* **[Roadmap Document](https://luma.gl/#/documentation/overview/roadmap)** - (this document) A high-level summary of our current direction for future releases.\n* **[Blog](https://medium.com/@vis.gl)** - We use the vis.gl blog to share information about what we are doing.\n* **[Github Issues](https://github.com/uber/luma.gl/issues)** - The traditional way to start or join a discussion.\n","slug":"docs","title":"Overview"},{"excerpt":"Module Structure luma.gl contains a lot of classes and functions that might make new users wonder where to get started. luma.gl therefore…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Module Structure\n\nluma.gl contains a lot of classes and functions that might make new users wonder where to get started. luma.gl therefore organize classes and functions into groups, as shown in the following table and also in the folder structure of the source code\n\n| New Module | Purpose |\n| ---------- | ------- |\n| constants | WebGL enum values |\n| shadertools| Tools for manipulating and composing shader text |\n| gltool     | Tooling and polyfilling for the WebGL context|\n| webgl      | Wrapper classes for WebGL |\n| core       | Single module re-exporting key parts of engine, webgl, shadertools |\n| engine     | High-level drawing APIs |\n| addons     | Experimental, unsupported APIs. Use at your own risk! |\n| debug      | Debug tooling for the other modules |\n| test-utils | Test tooling for the other modules |\n\n## WebGL Classes\n\nThe heart of luma.gl is the `webgl` module, a set of JavaScript class wrappers covering all WebGL objects. From luma.gl v4,\nAfter creating a context, perhaps with luma.gl's [`createGLContext`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/context.md) function, you have can start instantiating luma.gl's WebGL2 classes: [`Buffer`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/buffer.md), [`FrameBuffer`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/framebuffer.md), [`RenderBuffer`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/renderbuffer.md), [`Program`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/program.md), [`Shader`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/shader.md), [`Texture2D`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/texture-2d.md), [`Texture3D`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/texture-3d.md), [`TextureCube`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/texture-cube.md), [`Query`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/query.md), [`TransformFeedback`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/transform-feedback.md), [`VertexArrayObject`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/vertex-array.md)\n\n## Core Classes\n\nThe `core` classes, with the signature [`Model`](/docs/api-reference/core/model.md) class, represents a set of objects that is common in most 3D rendering libraries or engines. These objects are at higher abstraction levels than the actual WebGL objects and that can serve as the basic building blocks for most 3D applications.\n\n* [`Model`](/docs/api-reference/core/model.md) - A renderable object with program, attributes, uniforms and other state required for rendering 3D objects on the screen\n* [`Geometry`](/docs/api-reference/core/geometry.md) - Holds attributes and drawType for a primitive geometric object\n* [`AnimationLoop`](/docs/api-reference/core/animation-loop.md) - A simple animation loop that connects with browser's animation mechanism\n\n<!---\n* [`Object3D`](api-reference/core/object3d) - Base class, golds position, rotation, scale (TBD)\n* [`Group`](api-reference/core/group) - Supports recursive travesal and matrix transformation\n-->\n\n## Basic Geometries and Models\n\nA `Geometry` object holds a set of attributes (native JavaScript arrays) (vertices, normals, texCoords, indices) and a `drawMode` prop to indicate how to interpret those vertices and normals as actual geometries.\n\nThere are several basic geometry classes predefined in luma.gl: `Geometry`, `ConeGeometry`, `CubeGeometry`, `IcoSphereGeometry`, `PlaneGeometry`, `SphereGeometry`, `SphereGeometry`. They are all subclasses of the `Geometry` class.\n\nCorresponding to those geometry objects, luma.gl also provides commonly used [`Model`](/docs/api-reference/core/model.md) classes that consist of basic geometries. These include [`Cone`](/docs/api-reference/core/scenegraph/geometries/cone.md), [`Cube`](/docs/api-reference/core/scenegraph/geometries/cube.md), [`Cylinder`](/docs/api-reference/core/scenegraph/geometries/cylinder.md), [`IcoSphere`](/docs/api-reference/core/scenegraph/geometries/ico-sphere.md), [`Plane`](/docs/api-reference/core/scenegraph/geometries/plane.md) and [`Sphere`](/docs/api-reference/core/scenegraph/geometries/sphere.md), etc...\n\n\nUsers are encouraged to write their own geometries and models and luma.gl could include them in its future releases.\n","slug":"docs/api-reference","title":"Module Structure"},{"excerpt":"Debugging luma.gl has a number of provisions for debugging designed to help you save time during development. id strings Most classes in…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Debugging\n\nluma.gl has a number of provisions for debugging designed to help you save time during development.\n\n## id strings\n\nMost classes in luma.gl allow you to supply and optional `id` string to their constructors. This allows you to later easily check in the debugger which object (which specific instance of that class) is involved in a stack trace.\n\n```js\nconst program = new Program(gl, {id: 'cube-program', ...});\nconst program = new Program(gl, {id: 'pyramid-program', ...});\n```\n\n`id`s that you provide are also used by the built-in logging.\n\n\n## Logging\n\nluma.gl has a logging mechanism. Set the global variable luma.log.priority to 3 (can be done in the browser console at any time) and luma will print tables for uniforms and attributes providing information about their values and types before each render call. This can be extremely helpful for checking that shaders are getting valid inputs.\n\n\n## Shader compilation errors\n\nluma.gl takes care to extract as much information as possible about shader compiler errors etc, and will throw exceptions with very detailed error strings when shaders fail to compile. luma.gl also injects and parses `glslify` \"shader names\", making it possible to name shaders inside the shader code, making it easier to identify which shader is involved when e.g shader parsing errors occur.\n\n\n## Parameter Validation\n\nluma.gl runs checks on attributes and buffers when they are being set, catching many trivial errors such as setting uniforms to `undefined` or wrong type (scalar vs array etc).\n\nBuffers will also have their first values checked to ensure that they are not NaN. As an example, setting uniforms to illegal values now throws an exception containing a helpful error message including the name of the problematic uniform.\n\n\n## Debug Mode Contexts\n\n> Warning: Debug contexts impose a significant performance penalty (due to waiting for the GPU after each WebGL call to check error codes) and should not be used in production builds.\n\nluma.gl is pre-integrated with the Khronos group's WebGL debug tools (the [WebGLDeveloperTools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGLDeveloperTools)) and can use these to \"instrument\" `WebGLRenderingContext`s.\n\nThe `WebGLDeveloperTools` are automatically installed when luma.gl is installed, but are not actually bundled into the application unless explicitly imported. This avoids impacting the size of production bundles built on luma.gl that typically do not need debug support.\n\nTo use debug support, first import the debug tools, then call `getDebugContext` to create a debug contexts from a normal WebGL context:\n\n```js\nimport '@luma.gl/debug';\nconst gl = getDebugContext(gl);\n```\n\nIf the debug tools haven't been imported, `getDebugContext` will print a warning and simply return the original context, so the debug code can be left in the applicatin even when debug support is not imported.\n\nWhen the `luma.log.debug` flag is set, a debug contexts does the following:\n\n* **Detects WebGL Errors** - Check the WebGL error status after each WebGL call and throws an exception if an error was detected, taking care to extract helpful information into the error message. Raw WebGL calls tend to either fail silently or log something cryptic in the console without making it clear what call generated the warning.\n\n* **Checks WebGL Parameters** - WebGL parameter checks help catch a number of common WebGL coding mistakes, which is important since bad parameters in WebGL often lead to hard to debug symptoms such as silent failures to render, or to inscrutable error messages in the console.\n\n\n\n\n","slug":"docs/developer-guide/debugging","title":"Debugging"},{"excerpt":"Upgrade Guide Upgrading from v7.3 to v8.0 Module Restructure The module structure has been significantly changed for v8.0 with the intention…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Upgrade Guide\n\n## Upgrading from v7.3 to v8.0\n\n### Module Restructure\n\nThe module structure has been significantly changed for v8.0 with the intention of clarifying the purpose of each module and the relationships between them.\n\n| New Module | Purpose | Components from v7 |\n| ---------- | ------- |---------- |\n| constants | WebGL enum values | Same as before |\n| shadertools| Tools for manipulating and composing shader text | shadertools and effects |\n| gltool     | Tooling and polyfilling for the WebGL context| webgl2-polyfill and webgl-state-tracker|\n| webgl      | Wrapper classes for WebGL | Same as before |\n| core       | Single module re-exporting key parts of engine, webgl, shadertools | Same as before, less scenegraph classes which are now in addons |\n| engine     | High-level drawing APIs | core/model, core/animation-loop, core/resource-management, addons/animation, core/geometry, core/transform|\n| addons     | Experimental, unsupported APIs | core/scenegraph, gpgpu, addons/gltf, addons/webvr|\n| debug      | Debug tooling for the other modules | Same as before |\n| test-utils | Test tooling for the other modules | Same as before |\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- `Texture2D`'s `unpackFlipY` option is removed. This change ensures that all data sources (Image, ImageBitmap, typed array) are treated consistently. As a result, textures created from Image objects and URL strings are now y-flipped from the v7.3 default. To get the old behavior, specify the `pixelStore` option:\n\n```js\nnew Texture2D({\n  data,\n  pixelStore: {\n    [GL.UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL]: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Smaller changes\n\n- Functions are no longer accepted as uniform values to the `Model` class. The same effect can be achieved by updating the uniform values each frame prior to drawing.\n- `BaseModel` and `Model` have been consolidated in `Model`. `Model` be used as a substitute for `BaseModel` where necessary.\n- `AmbientLight`, `DirectionalLight`, `PointLight`, `PhongMaterial`, `PBRMaterial`, `CameraNode` have been removed from @luma.gl/core. These were either empty classes or simple data objects and so can be replaced by plain JavaScript objects in most cases.\n- `ShaderCache` has been removed and superseded by `ProgramManager`.\n- `registerShaderModules` has been removed. Modules can be imported and used directly where necessary.\n- `createShaderHook` and `createModuleInjection` have been removed. Used `ProgramManager.getDefaultProgramManger(gl).addShaderHook` && `ProgramManager.getDefaultProgramManger(gl).addModuleInjection` instead.\n- `VertexArray.getDrawParams` no longer takes overrides as an argument. The calling function can manually override values as needed.\n- @luma.gl/glfx has been renamed to @luma.gl/effects.\n- @luma.gl/main has been removed. Use individual modules instead.\n- `Multipass` classes have been removed.\n- Seer support has been removed.\n- Timeline and Keyframes have been moved from @luma.gl/addons to @luma.gl/engine.\n- `getParameter` and `setParameter` have been removed. Use `getParamters` and `setParameters` instead.\n\n\n## Upgrading from v7.2 to v7.3\n\n`ProgramManager` has replaced `ShaderCache` in the `Model` class as a more robust resource manager. Use of the `ShaderCache` with `Model` will not affect functionality in any way, but it is now a no-op.\n\n\n## Upgrading from v6.x to v7.0\n\nluma.gl v7.0 represents a major overhaul of the API. The majority of changes are in areas that are only infrequently used by applications, and the intention is that most applications should only require very light porting.\n\n\n## Core API Removals\n\n### Loading Functions Removed\n\nExtensive loading functionality is now provided by a new companion framework [loaders.gl](https://loaders.gl/) and because of this, most of the limited legacy luma.gl loading functions have been removed.\n\nFor the most common case (loading of images for use with textures), loading functions are no longer needed as the `data` prop in the `Texture2D` constructor now accepts url strings and `Promise` objects (this is the new Async Textures function).\n\n| Removed Function | Replacement  |\n| ---              | ---          |\n| `loadTexture(url, parameters)`  | `new Texture(gl, {data: url, parameters})` |\n| `loadFiles`      | Multiple calls to `loadFile` |\n| `loadImages`     | Multiple calls to `loadImage` |\n| `loadTextures`   | As per `loadTexture` |\n| `loadProgram`    | Manually load `fs` and `vs`, call `new Program(gl, {vs, fs})` |\n| `loadModel`      | call `loadFile` and copy `parseModel` code from examples/lesson/16|\n| `parseModel`     | call `loadFile` and copy `parseModel` code from examples/lesson/16 |\n\n### Attribute Class Removed\n\nThis experimental class has been moved to deck.gl and is now an internal class. Attribute accessor API improvements in luma.gl v7 should cover any issue.\n\n\n## WebGL API Removals\n\n### Sampler Class Removed\n\nThe `Sampler` class has been removed as its utility was limited and it added complexity to the library. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises.\n\n### Texture2DArray Class Removed\n\nThe `Texture2DArray` class has been removed as its utility was limited and the status of support was unclear due to limited testing. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises.\n\n### FenceSync Class Removed\n\nThe `FenceSync` class has been removed as its utility was limited. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises. If required, syncing can be done directly through the `WebGLFenceSync` object.\n\n## Framebuffer and Texture: Copy and Blit methods\n\nFollowing member function of `Framebuffer` and `Texture` classes are no longer supported, instead use the corresponding new global methods:\n\n| Removed method                  | Replacement |\n| ---                             | ---         |\n| `Framebuffer.readPixels`        | `readPixelsToArray` |\n| `Framebuffer.readPixelsToBuffer`| `readPixelsToBuffer` |\n| `Frambuffer.copyToDataUrl`      | `copyToDataUrl` |\n| `Frambuffer.copyToImage`        | `copyToImage` |\n| `Frambuffer.copyToTexture`      | `copyToTexture` |\n| `Frambuffer.blit`               | `blit` |\n| `Texture.copyFramebuffer`       | `copyToTexture` |\n\nParameters have also changed in some cases, see separate section.\n\n\n## Module Structure Changes\n\n### Debug functionality moved to separate npm module\n\nTo reduce bundle size and increase separation of concerns, debug functionality is now more cleanly separated from the core library and needs to be imported from a separate npm module:\n\nTo upgrade, install the new module\n\n```bash\nnpm install @luma.gl/debug\n```\n\nAnd replace\n\n```js\nimport \"luma.gl/debug\";\n````\nwith\n```js\nimport \"@luma.gl/debug\";\n```\n\n### Model\n\nChanges:\n* `Model` no longer extends `ScenegraphNode`. This ensures that applications that do not need scenegraph support do not need to include scenegraph related code. Use the new `ModelNode` class to inject `Models` into scenegraphs.\n\nDeletions:\n* Redraw flag handling has been removed: `Model.setNeedsRedraw()` and `Model.getNeedsRedraw()`.\n\nAdditions:\n* A new `Model.isAnimated()` method is provided, indicating that redraws are required every frame.\n\n## Geometry\n\nThe `Geometry` class has been simplified and is now a conceptually \"immutable\" class that holds typed arrays and accessor metatadata describing attributes for a geometry.\n\n| Removal                      | Replacement | Reason for Change |\n| ---                          | ---         | ---               |\n| `Geometry.drawMode` no longer accepts `String` values | `Geometry.DRAW_MODE` enum | API simplification |\n| `Geometry.setNeedsRedraw()`  | N/A | Not needed for immutable geometry |\n| `Geometry.getNeedsRedraw()`  | N/A | Not needed for immutable geometry |\n\n\n## Buffer\n\n| Removed Method               | Replacement | Reason for Change |\n| ---                          | ---         | ---               |\n| `Buffer.updateAccessor(...)` | `Buffer.setAccessor(new Accessor(buffer.accessor, ...)` | Decoupling accessors from `Buffer` |\n\n\n### Framebuffer\n\nTo maximize rendering performance, the default framebuffer is no longer preserved between frames.\n\nThe most common use case for preserving the draw buffer is capturing canvas contents into an image via `toDataURL`. This can now be done via `AnimationLoop.toDataURL` which returns a `Promise` that resolves to the canvas data URL:\n\n```js\ndataURL = await animationLoop.toDataURL();\nsnapshotImage.src = dataURL;\n```\n\nMore generally, moving code that depends on canvas contents to the end of `onRender`, after all draw operations, will ensure that canvas contents are available.\n\nPrior behaviour can re-enabled using the `glOptions` argument to the `createGLContext` or `AnimationLoop` constructors:\n\n```js\nnew AnimationLoop({\n  glOptions: {\n    preserveDrawingBuffer: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNote that setting `preserveDrawingBuffers` may result in a performance drop on some platforms.\n\n\n### Query\n\nUse `Query.getTimerMilliseconds` to retrieve timer results in milliseconds. `Query.getResult` now returns raw query results.\n\nTo improve performance and simplify the library, support for tracking `Query` instances with promises has changed: The `Query` constructor no longer takes `onComplete` and `onError` callbacks, and `pollGLContext` has been removed. Instead `Query.createPoll` now provides a simple, optional promise-based API.\n\n\n### Copy And Blit Parameter Unification\n\nNames of certain parameters to these methods have been unified in an effort to reduce confusion and use the same conventions across all functions implementing image read-back, copy or blit.\n\nThis table lists parameter mapping between old and new function.\n\n| `Framebuffer.readPixels` | `readPixelsToArray` |\n| ---                      | --- |\n| -                        | `source` |\n| `opts.x`                 | `opts.sourceX` |\n| `opts.y`                 | `opts.sourceY` |\n| `opts.width`             | `opts.sourceWidth` |\n| `opts.height`            | `opts.sourceHeight` |\n| `opts.format`            | `opts.sourceFormat` |\n| `opts.type`              | `opts.sourceType` |\n| `opts.attachment`        | `opts.sourceAttachment` |\n| `opts.pixelArray`        | `opts.target` |\n\n| `Framebuffer.readPixelsToBuffer` | `readPixelsToBuffer` |\n| ---               | --- |\n| -                 | `source` |\n| `opts.x`          | `opts.sourceX` |\n| `opts.y`          | `opts.sourceY` |\n| `opts.width`      | `opts.sourceWidth` |\n| `opts.height`     | `opts.sourceHeight` |\n| `opts.format`     | `opts.sourceFormat` |\n| `opts.type`       | `opts.sourceType` |\n| `opts.buffer`     | `opts.target` |\n| `opts.byteOffset` | `opts.targetByteOffset` |\n\n| `Framebuffer.copyToDataUrl` | `copyToDataUrl` |\n| ------------      | ---- |\n| -                 | `source` |\n| `opts.attachment` | `opts.sourceAttachment` |\n| `opts.maxheight`  | `opts.targetMaxHeight` |\n\n| `Framebuffer.copyToImage` | `copyToImage` |\n| ------------              | ---- |\n| -                         | `source` |\n| `opts.attachment`         | `opts.sourceAttachment` |\n| `opts.image`              | `opts.targetImage` |\n\n| `Framebuffer.copyToTexture` | `copyToTexture` |\n| ------------          | ---- |\n| -                     | `source` |\n| `opts.target`         | `target` |\n| `opts.texture`        | `target` |\n| `opts.x`              | `opts.sourceX` |\n| `opts.y`              | `opts.sourceY` |\n| `opts.xoffset`        | `opts.targetX` |\n| `opts.yoffset`        | `opts.targetY` |\n| `opts.zoffset`        | `opts.targetZ` |\n| `opts.width`          | `opts.width` |\n| `opts.height`         | `opts.height` |\n| `opts.internalFormat` | `opts.targetInternalFormat` |\n| `opts.mipmapLevel`    | `opts.targetMipmapLevel` |\n\n| `Texture.copyFramebuffer` | `copyToTexture` |\n| ------------           | ---- |\n| `opts.framebuffer` | `source` |\n| `opts.target`      | `target` |\n| `opts.x`           | `opts.sourceX` |\n| `opts.y`           | `opts.sourceY` |\n| `opts.width`       | `opts.width` |\n| `opts.height`      | `opts.height` |\n| `opts.internalFormat` | `opts.targetInternalFormat` |\n| `opts.level`       | `opts.targetMipmapLevel` |\n\n| `Framebuffer.blit` | `blit` |\n| ------------       | ---- |\n| `opts.srcFramebuffer` | `source` |\n| -                 | `target` |\n| `opts.attachment` | `opts.sourceAttachment` |\n| `opts.srcX0`      | `opts.sourceX0` |\n| `opts.srcX1`      | `opts.sourceX1` |\n| `opts.srcY0`      | `opts.sourceY0` |\n| `opts.srcY1`      | `opts.sourceY1` |\n| `opts.dstX0`      | `opts.targetX0` |\n| `opts.dstX1`      | `opts.targetX1` |\n| `opts.dstY0`      | `opts.targetY0` |\n| `opts.dstY1`      | `opts.targetY1` |\n| `opts.color`      | `opts.color` |\n| `opts.depth`      | `opts.depth` |\n| `opts.stencil`    | `opts.stencil` |\n| `opts.mask`       | `opts.mask` |\n| `opts.filter`     | `opts.filter` |\n\n\n### Geometry Scenegraph Models\n\nGeometry scenegraph models have been deprecated. Simply create a `Model` or `ModelNode` and explicitly pass a `Geometry` instance as\nan argument, e.g.:\n\n```js\n  const sphere = new Model(gl, {\n    geometry: new SphereGeometry({\n      nlat: 30,\n      nlong: 30,\n      radius: 2\n    })\n  });\n```\n\n## Upgrading from v5.3 to v6.0\n\nluma.gl v6.0 underwent a major API cleanup, resulting in a smaller, easier-to-learn API and smaller application bundles. While there are many smaller changes, the impact on most applications should be limited:\n\n* Most removed functions were in practice rarely used by applications, and the impact on typical luma.gl applications should be limited.\n* A number of API changes are related to moving attribute management from `Program` to `VertexArray`, however for higher level applications that work with the `Model` class rather than `Program` directly, there should not be much impact.\n\n\n### GL Constants Import Path\n\nThe biggest change for many apps will probably be that the static `GL` symbol (that contains all WebGL2 constants) must now be separately imported GL from 'luma.gl/constants'.\n\n\n### Experimental Exports: New Naming Convention\n\nExperimental exports are now prefixed with underscore (\\_). The `experimental` \"name space\" export has been removed.\n\n```js\n// NOW: luma.gl v6\nimport {_Attribute as Attribute} from 'luma.gl';\n\n// BEFORE: luma.gl v5.x\nimport {experimental} from 'luma.gl';\nconst {Attribute} = experimental;\n```\n\nThis change will enable tree-shaking bundlers to remove unused experimental exports, resulting in smaller final application bundles.\n\n\n### Removed symbols\n\nMath functions were moved from luma.gl to the separate math.gl module in v4.1. As of v6.0, they are no longer forwarded by luma.gl and now need to be imported directly from math.gl:\n\n```js\nimport {radians, degrees, Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Matrix4} from 'math.gl';\n```\n\nluma.gl v6.0 removes a number of previously deprecated symbols. luma.gl will now issue an error rather than a warning if the old usage is detecated.\n\n\n### Constants\n\n| Removed

It is recommended that you replace their usage in your source code.\n\n| Deprecated symbol                | Replacement                     | Reason     |\n| ---                              | ---                             | --         |\n| `GL`                             | `import GL from 'luma.gl/constants'` | Bundle size concerns |\n| `deleteGLContest`                | `destroyGLContext`              | API Audit: Naming alignment |\n| `pollContext`                    | `pollGLContext`                 | API Audit: Naming alignment |\n\n\n## Upgrading from v5.1 to v5.2\n\n### Running under Node.js\n\n[Using with Node](/docs/get-started/README.md): `\"import luma.gl/headless\"` is no longer required for luma.gl to load headless gl and the usage has been deprecated. You can now simply remove any such import statements from your code.\n\n\n### Using Debug Contexts\n\n[Debugging](/docs/developer-guide/debugging.md): The Khronos group's `WebGLDeveloperTools` are automatically installed when luma.gl is installed, but are not actually bundled into the application unless explicitly imported. This avoids impacting the size of production bundles built on luma.gl that typically do not need debug support.\n\nTo use debug support, first import the debug tools, then call `getDebugContext` to create a debug contexts from a normal WebGL context:\n\n```js\nimport \"luma.gl/debug\";\nconst gl = getDebugContext(gl);\n```\n\n\n## Upgrading from v4 to v5\n\nPlease read this documentation before upgrading your luma.gl dependency from v4 to v5. In v5 a number of previously deprecated features have been removed and a number of additional deprecations have been made at the same time.\n\nBefore upgrading to v5, it is highly recommended to run your application using latest v4 release, and check the console for any deprecated warnings, if there are any replace deprecated API with newer API as listed below.\n\n### Model Class\n\nThe `Model` constructor expects a gl context as the first argument.\n\n```js\n  // v5\n  Model(gl)\n  Model(gl, {...opts});\n  Model(gl, {program});\n```\n\nFollowing style construction was deprecated in v4 and is now removed in v5.\n\n```js\n  // NOT SUPPORTED\n  Model({gl});\n  Model({gl, ...opts});\n  Model({program});\n```\n\n### useDevicePixelRatio\n\n`useDevicePixelRatio` is used as a an argument in `AnimationLoop` class constructor and `pickModels` method. It is now deprecated in v5, but still supported with a warning message and will be removed in next major version update. It is recommended to use `useDevicePixels` instead.\n\n### Geometry\n\n`Geometry` class construction with inline attributes was deprecated in v4 and now removed in v5.\n\n```js\n// NOT SUPPORTED\nnew Geometry({\n  positions: new Float32Array([ ... ]),\n  colors: {\n    size: 4,\n    value: new Float32Array([ ... ])\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAll attributes should be grouped inside `attribute` object.\n\n```js\n// SUPPORTED\nnew Geometry({\n attributes: {\n   positions: new Float32Array([ ... ]),\n   colors: {\n     size: 4,\n     value: new Float32Array([ ... ])\n   }\n }\n});\n```\n\n### Removed Features\n\nFollowing features were deprecated in v3 and v4 are now removed in v5.\n\n* Global symbols:\n\n| Removed symbol / Usage | Replacement    | Comment |\n| ---                  | ---              | --      |\n| `withState`          | `withParameters` | State management |\n| `glContextWithState` | `withParameters` | State management |\n|`withParameters({frameBuffer})`| `withParameters({framebuffer})`| State management |\n| `MONOLITHIC_SHADERS` | `MODULAR_SHADERS` | default shaders |\n| `isWebGLContext` | `isWebGL` | WebGL context validation |\n| `isWebGL2Context` | `isWebGL2` | WebGL2 context validation |\n| `Camera`, `PerspectiveCamera`, `OrthoCamera` | `None` | |\n| `Scene` | `None` | |\n\n* Texture construction options:\n\n| Removed symbol / Usage | Replacement    |\n| ---                  | ---              |\n| `generateMipmaps` | `mipmaps` |\n| `magFilter` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER]` |\n| `minFilter` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER]` |\n| `wrapS` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_WRAP_S]` |\n| `wrapT` | `parameters[GL.TEXTURE_WRAP_T]` |\n\n\n## Upgrading from v3 to v4\n\nluma.gl v4 is a major release with API changes. Please read this documentation before upgrading your luma.gl's dependency from v3 to v4.\nIn addition, a number of previously deprecated features have been removed and a number of additional deprecations have been made at the same time in this version.\n\n\n## Removed Features\n\nSome previously deprecated classes and functions have been removed in luma.gl v4 and applications must be updated with the new classes and functions if they are still using these.\n\n| Symbol               | Replacement      | Comment |\n| ---                  | ---              | --- |\n| `Vec3`               | `Vector3`        | [New math library]( https://github.com/uber-web/math.gl) |\n| `Mat4`               | `Matrix4`        | [New math library]( https://github.com/uber-web/math.gl) |\n| `Quat`               | `Quaternion`     | [New math library]( https://github.com/uber-web/math.gl) |\n\n\n## Deprecated Features\n\nSome classes and functions have been deprecated in luma.gl v4. They will continue to function in v4, but a warning in the console will be generated. These functions are expected to be removed in a future major versions of luma.gl.\n\n\n| Symbol               | Replacement      | Comment |\n| ---                  | ---              | --- |\n| `withState`          | `withParameters` | [New WebGL state management](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/with-parameters.md) |\n| `glContextWithState` | `withParameters` | [New WebGL state management](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/with-parameters.md) |\n\n\n## API Change\n\n### Model Class\n\nThe `Model` constructor now expects a gl context as the first argument.\n\n```js\n  // v3\n  Model({gl});\n  Model({gl, ...opts});\n  Model({program});\n\n  // v4\n  Model(gl)\n  Model(gl, {...opts});\n  Model(gl, {program});\n```\n\nthe gl context used to be extracted from the supplied program or provided along side with other options, but in luma.gl v4, it is expected as a separate argument to the constructor. This change is because luma.gl v4 emphasizes sharing shaders rather than programs (often indirectly via shader caching / shader assembly), it is less common that a gl context is available.\n\n\n## Upgrading from V2 to V3\n\nV3 was a fairly minor release, a number of deprecations were made.\n\n### Deprecations\n\n| Symbol               | Replacement      | Comment |\n| ---                  | ---              | --- |\n| `Vec3`               | `Vector3`        | [New math library]( https://github.com/uber-web/math.gl) |\n| `Mat4`               | `Matrix4`        | [New math library]( https://github.com/uber-web/math.gl) |\n| `Quat`               | `Quaternion`     | [New math library]( https://github.com/uber-web/math.gl) |\n","slug":"docs/upgrade-guide","title":"Upgrade Guide"},{"excerpt":"Accessors \"Buffer accessor objects\" (or \"accessor objects\", or just \"accessors\" for short) are used to describe the structure of data…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Accessors\n\n\"Buffer accessor objects\" (or \"accessor objects\", or just \"accessors\" for short) are used to describe the structure of data contained in WebGL buffers (for more information see [`Buffers`](developers-guide/buffers.md)).\n\nWhen using `Buffer`s as input to shader programs, applications must tell WebGL how the data in the buffer is formatted, so that the GPU knows how to access buffers' memory. To enable applications to specify how the buffer memory should be accessed, luma.gl APIs that set attribute buffers accept buffer \"accessor objects\".\n\n## Accessor Object Fields\n\nThis is an overview of the object accessor fields that are available to applications to define format descriptions. These objects can contain the following fields, this is an excerpt from [`Accessor`](api-reference/webgl/accessor.md).\n\n| Property    | Auto Deduced | Default    | Comment |\n| ---         | ---          | ---        | ---        | ---     |\n| `buffer`    | No           | An accessor can optionally reference a specific buffer. Multiple accessors can point to the same buffer, providing different views or \"slices\" of the buffer's memory. |\n| `offset`    | No           | `0`        | Byte offset to start of data in buffer |\n| `stride`    | No           | `0`        | Extra bytes between each successive data element |\n| `type`      | Yes          | `GL.FLOAT` | Low level data type (`GL.BYTE`, `GL.SHORT`, ...) |\n| `size`      | Yes          | `1`        | Components per element (`1`-`4`) |\n| `divisor`   | Yes          | `0`        | Enables/disables instancing |\n| `normalize` | N/A          | `false`    | Normalize integers to [-1,1], or [0,1] if unsigned |\n| `integer`   | N/A          | `false`    | Disable conversion of integer values to floats **WebGL2** |\n\n\n## Combining Accessors with Buffers\n\nWhen setting attributes (e.g. using `Model.setProps({attributes: {attributeName: value, ...}}))`, each attribute value needs to contain both a buffer (a handle to the raw data uploaded to the GPU) and an accessor (describing how that data should be accessed).\n\nluma.gl provides three methods to specify attribute values so that both a buffer and an accessor are provided:\n* As a two-element array: `[buffer, accessor]`.\n* As an accessor, in which case the accessor object's `buffer` field should be set to the matching `Buffer`.\n* As a `Buffer`, in which case the `Buffer` objects `accessor` field should be set to the mathing `Accessor`.\n\nAll three methods have their uses: the first option gives the applications full freedom to dynamically select combinations of buffers and accessors, the second option is often the natural choice when working with interleaved buffers (see below), and the last choice is often the most convenient when just setting up an ad-hoc buffer for immediate use, as the accessor can be stored directly on the buffer, avoiding the need to manage separate objects.\n\n\n## Accessor Class vs Accessor Objects\n\nluma.gl provides the [`Accessor`](api-reference/webgl/accessor.md) helper class to help you work with accessor objects. For instance, the `Accessor` class supports merging of partial accessor objects, see below.\n\nNote that it is not necessary to use the `Accessor` class, as plain old JavaScript objects with the appropriate fields are also accepted by the various APIs that accept accessors. Use the style that works best for your application.\n\n\n### \"Partial\" Accessors\n\nluma.gl allows \"partial\" accessors to be created, and later combined. Usually many accessor fields can be left undefined (e.g. because defaults are sufficient, or because accessor auto-deduction has already deduced the information, see below).\n\nPartial accessors will be created automatically by `Program` when shaders are compiled and linked, and also by `Buffer` objects when they are created. Any application supplied accessors fields will then be merged in (override) these auto-deduceted fields, that can add any fine-tuning or override of parameters.\n\n\n### Accessor Auto Deduction\n\nluma.gl attempts to \"auto deduce\" as much accessor information as it can, for instance luma.gl can extract fields like `type` and `size` after shaders have been compiled.\n\nThis relieves applications from having to respecify the same thing multiple times. For instance if the application has already declared an attribute as `in vec2 size` in the vertex shader, it does not need to specify `size:2, type: GL.FLOAT` again in the accessor, when it sets the buffer in JavaScript, since this information will have been auto-deduced.\n\nIn many cases, when buffers are not shared between attributes (i.e. interleaved) and default behavior is desired, luma.gl applications often do not need to specify any `Accessor` at all.\n\n\n### Merging (Resolving) Accessors\n\nThe `Accessor` API allows for accessors to be merged (or \"resolved\") into a new `Accessor`. Accessor mmerging is mainly used internally in luma.gl to implement support for partial accessors and accessor auto deduction, but can be used by applications if necessary.\n\n\n### Data Interleaving\n\nUsing the`stride` and `offset` fields in accessor objects, it is possible to interleave two arrays so that the first two elements of one array are next to each other, then the next two elements etc.\n\n```\nconst interleavedBuffer = new Buffer(gl, accessor: {stride: 12 + 4}}); // Creates a partial accessor with `stride` in buffer.\n\nvertexArray.setAttributes({\n  // These accessors are merged with the `interleavedBuffer` accessor and any\n  // auto-deduced accessors\n  POSITIONS: new Accessor({offset: 0, buffer: interleavedBuffer})\n  COLORS: new Accessor({offset: 12, buffer: interleavedBuffer})\n})\n```\n\nFor more information see the article about attributes.\n\n\n### Using Different Size in Buffers and Shaders\n\nIt is possible to use different size memory attributes than specified by the GLSL shader code, by specifying a different size in the accessor compared to the GLSL shader variable declaration. Extra components in the Buffer memory will be ignored, missing components will be filled in from `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)`\n\n> Be aware that the headless gl integration does not support this feature due to limitations in headless gl.\n\n\n### glTF Format Accessors\n\n[glTF formatted files](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/). glTF files contain two JSON object arrays (\"bufferViews\" and \"accessors\") that describe how raw memory buffers are organized and should be interpreted.\n\nThe `Accessor` and `Buffer` class APIs have intentionally been designed to be a close representation when converting \"accessors\" and \"bufferViews\" stored in glTF files. Each glTF `accessor` can be mapped to a luma.gl `Accessor` and each glTF `bufferView` can be mapped to a luma.gl `Buffer`.

The test renders 1000 [ScatterplotLayers](https://deck.gl/#/examples/core-layers/scatterplot-layer), each of which draws 100 intanced geometries, for a total of 1000 draw calls and 100,000 instances. Timings are milliseconds spent on the CPU and GPU to render a single frame on the following two machines:\n\n- Macbook Pro 2018, OSX, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB\n- Razer Blade, Windows 10, Intel i7-8750H 6 Core, Intel UHD Graphics 630\n\n||  No Program Sharing |Program Sharing | Improvement |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Macbook Pro CPU | 113ms | 93ms | 17% |\n| Macbook Pro GPU | 43ms   | 34ms  | 20% |\n| Razer Blade CPU | 145ms | 125ms | 13% |\n| Razer Blade GPU | 137ms | 115ms | 16% |\n\n\n\n### Custom Device Pixels (Experimental)\n\nluma.gl now provides experimental support for specifying the pixel ratio mapping between canvas size and the GL drawing buffer. luma.gl has always provided support for matching the native device pixel ratio on high-resolution screens, but custom ratios allow applications to, for example, use SSAA for improved fidelity or reduced drawing resolution to improve performance.\n\n\n## Version 7.2\n\nDate: July 9, 2019\n\n### FXAA Shader Module\n\nluma.gl now supports FXAA (Fast Approximate Antialiasing) as a post processing effect. This allows for antialiasing on offscreen framebuffers.\n\n### ImageBitmap Textures\n\nThe `Texture` class now supports `ImageBitmap` input data.\n\n\n## Version 7.1\n\nDate: June 4, 2019\n\n### Enhanced Shader Injection System\n\nluma.gl now supports a much more robust system for injecting code into shaders. In addition to the pre-defined shader hooks such as `vs:#main-start`,\nthe shader injection system now supports:\n- Definition of arbitrary shader hook functions that can be called anywhere in a shader\n- Injection of arbitrary code into shader hook functions to modify their behavior\n- Automatic injection by shader modules into hook functions or pre-defined shader hooks\n\nThe combination of these features allows the behavior of the same shader code to be modified depending on included shader modules or other\nrequirements of the application. See [assembleShaders](/docs/api-reference/shadertools/assemble-shaders.md) documentation for more details.\n\n### Animation Support\n\nMore robust animations are now supported via the `Timeline` and `KeyFrames` classes.\n\nThe  `Timeline` class supports easily managing a timeline with multiple channels elapsing at different rates, as well as orchestrating playing, pausing, and rewinding behavior between them. A timeline can be attached to an `AnimationLoop` and then queried for time values, which can be used in animations. See [Timeline](/docs/api-reference/addons/animation/timeline.md) documentation for more details.\n\nThe `KeyFrames` class allows arbitrary data to be associated with time points. The time value of the key frames can be set and the current key frames and interpolation factor can be queried and used in calculating animated values. See [KeyFrames](/docs/api-reference/addons/animation/key-frames.md) documentation for more details.\n\n## Version 7.0\n\nDate: April 19, 2019\n\n<table style=\"border: 0;\" align=\"center\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img height=200 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/gltf-city.gif\" />\n        <p><i>glTF Support</i></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img height=200 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/gltf-pbr.gif\" />\n        <p><i>PBR (Physically Based Rendering)</i></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n### glTF Support\n\n<img height=100 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/gltf.png\" />\n\nluma.gl can now load 3D models and scenegraphs in the popular [glTF™](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) asset format (with the help of the loaders.gl [GLTFLoader](https://github.com/uber-web/loaders.gl/blob/master/website/docs/api-reference/gltf-loaders/gltf-loader.md). All variants of glTF 2.0 are supported, including binary `.glb` files as well as JSON `.gltf` files with binary assets in base64 encoding or in separate files. The Draco Mesh compression extension is also supported.\n\n- **Physically-based Material Support**: Ensures that PBR models display as intended.\n- **Scenegraph Improvements**: The Scenegraph classes have been refactored to ensure support for glTF objects.\n- **Geometry glTF Support**: The `Geometry` class and scene graph support has been overhauled to conform to glTF conventions, simplifying loading and manipulation of glTF formatted data.\n\n\n### loaders.gl Integration\n\n[loaders.gl](https://uber-web.github.io/loaders.gl/) is a major new companion framework to luma.gl that provides a suite of 3D file format loaders (with an emphasizis on point cloud formats), including:\n\n* Draco\n* PLY\n* PCD\n* LAS/LAZ\n* OBJ\n\nloaders.gl output can now be passed directly into luma.gl classes like `Geometry` and `Model` making it straightforward to use luma.gl with a wide variety of file formats.\n\n\n### Asynchronous Textures\n\nImage data for `Texture` classes can now be supplied using URLs or `Promise`s, making it unnecessary for applications to handle image loading themselves.\n\n```js\nnew Texture2D(gl, 'path/to/my/image.png'); // Texture2D will load the image and becomes 'renderable' once it loads\n// or\nnew Texture2D(gl, loadImage('path/to/my/image.png')); // loadImage returns a promise\n```\n\n### Lighting\n\nA standardized set of light classes are now supported by multiple material models (Phong, Goraud and PBR) enabling various models to be mixed and properly lit in the same scene.\n\n\n### Modularization Improvements\n\n- luma.gl has been restructured to make it easier for applications to select and import only parts of the library that they use.\n\n* ` @luma.gl/gpgpu` **<sup>New</sup>** - A new experimental submodule with GPGPU Algorithms and Utilities has been added, containing a growing collection of GPU accelerated algorithms and utility methods.\n\n\n### Performance Instrumentation\n\nExtensive metrics about frame CPU and GPU times, resource counts, and GPU memory usage are being collected. The data is exposed as a [probe.gl](https://uber-web.github.io/probe.gl/#/) [`Stats`](https://uber-web.github.io/probe.gl/#/documentation/api-reference-logging/stats) object. The new probe.gl [StatsWidget](https://uber-web.github.io/probe.gl/#/documentation/api-reference-widgets/statswidget) can be used to present data in applications.\n\n\n### Interleaved Attributes\n\nTo improve support for interleaved attributes and glTF model loading, accessor objecs and the `Accessor` class now support a `buffer` field. In addition, attribute setting functions now accept accessor objects with the `buffer` field set. This allows multiple accessor objects referencing the same buffer:\n\n```\nconst buffer = // \"interleaved\" vertex attributes: 3 floats for position followed by 4 bytes for RGBA\nmodel.setAttributes({\n  positions: {buffer, stride: 16, offset: 0, ...}}),\n  colors: {buffer, stride: 16, offset: 12, ...}})\n}\n```\n\n### Unified functions for Framebuffers and Textures (Read/Copy/Blit)\n\nA set of global methods that perform copying data to and from `Framebuffer` objects. All functions that read from or write to a `Framebuffer` object now also accept a `Texture` object (no need to create and configure a `Framebuffer` just to do a simple operation on a `Texture`).\n\n\n## Experimental Features\n\n### WebVR Support (experimental)\n\nJust replace your `AnimationLoop` with `VRAnimationLoop` from ` @luma.gl/addons`. Works with [Firefox Reality](https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/firefox-reality/).\n\n\n\n## Version 6.4\n\nDate: January 29, 2018\n\n### PBR (Physically Based) Rendering and Material\n\nPhysically-Based Rendering is now supported and the new `PBRMaterial` class can be used to set up parameters. Material can be selected per model.\n\n\n### Copy and Blit methods\n\nSeveral member function of `Framebuffer` and `Texture` classes are now replaced by global methods that peform copying data to and from `Framebuffer` objects. All methods that read from or write to a `Framebuffer` object, can now also accept a `Texture` object.\n\n\n## Version 6.3\n\nDate: November 16, 2018\n\n### Uniform Caching\n\nUniforms are now cached at `Program` object, which improves performance by eliminating uniform setter calls when uniform values are not changed.\n\n### New submodules\n\n* `@luma.gl/debug` - an experimental module for debugging WebGL shaders on CPU\n* `@luma.gl/glfx` - shader modules for image processing\n\n### Offscreen Rendering (Experimental)\n\nA new experimental class `AnimationLoopProxy` supports running an `AnimationLoop` on a worker thread using the `OffscreenCanvas` API made official in Chrome 70. For more detatils, see [API documentation](/docs/api-reference/core/animation-loop-proxy.md) and [example app](https://github.com/uber/luma.gl/tree/7.3-release/test/apps/wip/worker).\n\n\n## Version 6.2\n\nDate: September 12, 2018\n\n<table style=\"border: 0;\" align=\"center\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img height=150 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/render-pass.gif\" />\n        <p><i>glfx port using ShaderModulePass</i></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img height=150 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/transform-texture.gif\" />\n        <p><i>Transform: edge detection</i></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### ShaderModulePass (Experimental)\n\nShader modules that expose \"standard\" filtering and sampling functions can be given extra metadata (the `passes` field) enabling easy construction of a `ShaderModulePass`. Look for `ShaderPass` badges in the documentation of shader modules.\n\n### Transform Texture support (Experimental)\n\n`Transform` class was introduced in 6.0 provides easy API to perform WebGL's complicated `TransformFeedback`. We are now extending this class to provide same easy API to read and write into textures. Running image filters, performing offline rendering and custom texture mip-map generation are some of the use-cases. Moreover, texture and buffer access can be combined, i.e. using single `Transform` instance buffers can be captured using `TransformFeedback` and data can be propagated beyond vertex shader to generate a texture.\n\n\n## Version 6.1\n\nDate: Target August 31, 2018\n\n<table style=\"border: 0;\" align=\"center\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img height=150 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/luma61-ssao-pass-thumb.gif\" />\n        <p><i>Ambient Occlusion Render Pass</i></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <img height=150 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/luma61-edge-pass-thumb.gif\" />\n        <p><i>Edge Detection Render Pass</i></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nluma.gl 6.1 is a minor release that introduces a number of new experimental capabilities that are expected to be built out and become official over the next few releases.\n\n\n### New Multipass Rendering System (Experimental)\n\nluma.gl now provides a composable multipass rendering framework, based on a `MultiPassRenderer` class that accepts a list of render passes.\n\n\n### Post-Processing Effects (Experimental)\n\nA number of classic WebGL/OpenGL post processing effects have been ported to luma.gl and packaged as composable render passes. For maxiumum flexibility, many of the underlying shaders have also been exposed as shader modules, allowing filtering features to be used either directly in existing shaders or applied as a post-processing filter.\n\n\n### New loaders.gl Submodule (Experimental)\n\nA selection of open source 3D loaders have been ported to a new submodule `loaders.gl`. Initial focus is on point cloud loaders (PLY, LAZ, PCD), although a geospatial loader (KML) is also included. In addition it contains both read and write support for GLB (the glTF binary container format).\n\n\n### Transform Class now supports Shader Modules\n\nThe `Transform` class now accepts shader module parameters (such as `modules`, `dependencies` and `inject`, see [assembleShaders](/docs/api-reference/shadertools/assemble-shaders.md)), enabling the use of shader modules in transform feedback operations.\n\n\n### Documentation Search\n\nluma.gl is now using the [ocular](https://github.com/uber-web/ocular) document generator to build its website, which among other things enables search.\n\n\n## Version 6.0\n\nDate: July 18, 2018\n\n<table style=\"border: 0;\" align=\"center\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img height=150 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/webgl2.jpg\" />\n        <p><i>WebGL Improvements</i></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nA major release that as always focuses on WebGL performance and code size optimizations, better support for shader/GLSL programming, improved documentation and API cleanup.\n\n\n## WebGL Improvements\n\n### Attribute Management Optimizations\n\n`VertexArray` objects are now used for all attribute management in luma.gl, resulting in improved performance and a simpler, more consistent API. The `Program` and `Model` class APIs have been updated to use `VertexArray`.\n\n### Buffer Memory Optimizations\n\nThe `Buffer` class no longer holds on to the complete JavaScript typed arrays used during initialization. This can lead to significant memory savings in apps that use multiple large GPU buffers initialized from typed arrays. Also for convenience a new method `getElementCount` is added that returns number elements based on its size and type.\n\n### Transform Feedback Improvements\n\nA new method `Model.transform` makes it easier to run basic transform feedback operations, when the full power of the new `Transform` class (see below) is not needed.\n\n\n### Transform class (WebGL2)\n\n[`Transform`](/docs/api-reference/core/transform.md) is now an officially supported luma.gl class. This new class provides an easy-to-use interface to Transform Feedback. This class hides complexity by internally creating and managing the supporing WebGL objects that are necessary to perform Transform Feedback operations.\n\n\n## Shader Module System Improvements\n\n### GLSL Transpilation\n\nThe shader assembler now transforms shader code to the GLSL version specified by the top-level shader. GLSL 3.00 ES shader code is transparently transformed into GLSL 1.00 ES compatible code when needed, and vice versa. This allows application to write shader code in the modern GLSL version available (3.00 ES) and still run it under WebGL1 - Shader \"transpilation\" will automatically convert shader module source code syntax to the target version (assuming that no WebGL2 only features were used).\n\n\n### Shader Code Injection\n\nA new shader injection system allows applications to inject additional code into existing shaders. In many cases, this can avoid the need to copy (or \"fork\") large and complicated existing shaders just to add a few lines of code.\n\nShader injection can be used to \"inject\" new shader modules into an existing shader. Adding a shader module to the modules list automatically \"prepends\" the shader module functions to the beginning of your main shader code, but using a shader module still typically requires adding one or two lines of code each to the main functions in the vertex and fragment shaders. In many cases, the new shader injection feature allows this be done without copying the original shaders.\n\n\n### Shader Modules now support GLSL 3.00 ES\n\nAll shader modules are now written in GLSL 3.00 syntax, and leverage the new GLSL transpilation feature to be compatible with both GLSL 3.00 ES and GLSL 1.00 ES main shaders. Care is taken to avoid using GLSL 3.00 specific features whenever possible, and exceptions will be clearly documented.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Developer's Guide\n\nluma.gl now has a more extensive Developer's Guide covering more areas of the API, including a new developer guide for shader programming, with sections about writing shaders and the shader module system. Content includes:\n\n- Guidelines for writing shaders that work in both GLSL 3.00 ES and GLSL 1.00 ES\n- A new GLSL language reference page describing both GLSL 3.00 ES and GLSL 1.00 ES (as well as what has changed between them) in a single place.\n\n\n## API Cleanup\n\nBeing a major release, in v6.0 we took the opportunity to clean up the luma.gl API.\n\n\n### Removal of Deprecated/Unused Methods\n\nTo keep reducing application bundle size, a number of methods have been removed from the luma.gl API. Methods that were deprecated in previous releases have now been removed, and in additional a number of rarely used methods have also been dropped (in most cases, the dropped functionality is still accessible using raw WebGL calls).\n\n### Renamed Methods\n\nIn a few cases, methods have been renamed after API Audits, usually to improve API consistency. The details are listed in the Upgrade Guide. In most cases, running your pre-v6 application on v6 should generate messages in the console when old method calls are encountered, and you should be able to quickly address any changes one-by-one by referring to the Upgrade Guide.\n\n\n\n## Version 5.3\n\nDate: June 1, 2018\n\nA minor release with bug fixes and internal improvements.\n\n\n## Version 5.2\n\nDate: Apr 24, 2018\n\n## Transform class (WebGL2, Experimental)\n\nThe new experimental [`Transform`](/docs/api-reference/core/transform.md) class provides an easy-to-use interface to perform Transform Feedback operations.\n\n\n## Framebuffer Class\n\n**Pixel Readback to GPU Buffers** (WebGL2) - A new method [`Framebuffer.readPixelsToBuffer`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/framebuffer.md) is added to asynchronously read pixel data into a `Buffer` object. This allows  applications to reduce the CPU-GPU sync time by postponing transfer of data or to completely avoid GPU-CPU sync by using the pixel data in the GPU `Buffer` object directly as data source for another GPU draw or transform feedback operation.\n\n\n## Bundle Size Reduction\n\nThe impact of importing luma.gl on production application bundle sizes has been reduced, in particular when using webpack 4 with appropriate configuration. A new article about [bundling and tree shaking](/docs/developer-guide/building-apps.md) has been added to the Developer Guide, providing in-depth information and guidance on what numbers to expect.\n\n\n## Running luma.gl in Node.js\n\nRunning of luma.gl under Node.js is now easier than ever. luma.gl v5.2 automatically loads headless-gl if installed on the system, avoiding the need for the app to import special files or add other conditional logic. See [Using with Node](/docs/get-started/README.md) and the Upgrade Guide.\n\n\n## Debug Mode Changes\n\nTo further reduce production application bundle sizes, luma.gl no longer support WebGL debug contexts by default, as this requires including the Khronos [WebGLDeveloperTools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGLDeveloperTools) into the bundle. WebGL debug contexts are still available, but needs to be explicitly enabled. To understand how to use WebGL debug contexts in v5.2, please refer to the article on [Debugging](/docs/developer-guide/debugging.md) and the Upgrade Guide.\n\n\n## Examples\n\nAll examples have been updated to use webpack 4\n\n\n## Version 5.1\n\nA smaller release with improvements to `TransformFeedback` support.\n\nDate: Feb 15, 2018\n\n## TransformFeedback Class\n\nTwo improvements Performing Transform Feedback operations has gotten easier, mainly in the following two ways:\n\n`TransformFeedback` instances can now be supplied directly to `Model.draw` and feedback will begin and end during that draw call. Thus it is no longer necessary to work directly with the `Program` class to use transform feedback.\n\n`Program` now build a `varyingMap` on creation depending on `varyings` array and `drawMode`. This `varyingMap` can be passed to `TransformFeedback.bindBuffers()` enabling buffers to be indexed by the name of the \"varying\" instead of using an index.\n\nFor more details check [`TransformFeedback`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/transform-feedback.md) and [`Model`](/docs/api-reference/core/model.md) documentation.\n\n\n## Version 5.0\n\nDate: Dec 22, 2017\n\nA smaller release with several new examples and some under the hood changes to improve performance.\n\n\n### Examples\n\nAdditional examples have been ported to the luma.gl v5 API.\n\n* [Lesson 10](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-10-3d-world)\n* [Lesson 11](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-11-sphere)\n* [Lesson 12](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-12-point-lighting)\n* [Lesson 13](http://uber.github.io/luma.gl/#/examples/webgl-lessons/lesson-13-per-fragment-lighting)\n\n\n### Model Class\n\n* `Model.draw` now supports a `moduleSettings` parameters to update shader module settings.\n* `Model.render` now supports `attributes` and `samplers` arguments to be used for drawing.\n\n\n### Framebuffer Binding Management\n\nIn v4 we added WebGL state management which automatically tracks all WebGL state settings. In this release we extended this feature to support framebuffer bindings. When restoring context settings, the previous framebuffer binding will also be restored.\n\n\n### WebGL2 Improvements\n\nImprovements in particular to the `Buffer`, `TransformFeedback` and `Framebuffer` classes based on use in applications.\n\n\n### Shader Modules\n\n* `fp64` - fp64 module works under more platforms/GPUs/drivers\n* [`picking`](/docs/api-reference/shadertools/shader-module-picking.md) shader module is moved from deck.gl to luma.gl and has been enhanced to also support object highlighting.\n\n\n\n## Version 4.0\n\nRelease date: July 27th, 2017\n\n<table style=\"border: 0;\" align=\"center\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <img height=150 src=\"https://raw.github.com/uber-common/deck.gl-data/master/images/whats-new/webgl2.jpg\" />\n        <p><i>WebGL 2</i></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nA major release that brings full WebGL2 support to luma.gl, as well as adding support for GL state management and a new shader module system.\n\n\n### Full WebGL2 Support\n\nluma.gl now exposes the complete WebGL2 APIs:\n\n* New classes expose all the new WebGL2 objects ([`Query`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/query.md), [`Texture3D`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/texture-3d.md), and [`TransformFeedback`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/transform-feedback.md)), together with a new [`UniformBufferLayout`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/uniform-buffer-layout.md) helper class to make uniform buffers easy to use.\n* Other existing WebGL classes with new functionalites under WebGL2 have been updated.\n* Add new WebGL2 texture formats and types support, including floating point textures, and multiple render targets.\n\n\n### WebGL Capability Management\n\nluma.gl provides a single unified WebGL2-style API across WebGL2, WebGL1 and WebGL extensions, and provides a simple mechanisms for querying what capabilities are available. This simplifies building apps that run on both WebGL1 and WebGL2, seamlessly allowing applications to leverage WebGL extensions when available.\n\n\n### WebGL State Management\n\nIn this version, a new WebGL state management is implemented to help address one of the weak spots of the stateful WebGL API:\n\n* luma.gl can track certain WebGL context state changes so the app could easily set and reset WebGL states for certain operations.\n* luma.gl also has a host-side WebGL state caching system that records certain WebGL states so that expansive queries into the GPU or underlying OpenGL driver won't be necessary.\n\n\n### shadertools - A New Shader Module System\n\n* The new, optional, shadertools module with the `assembleShaders` function system allows shader code to be broken into composable pieces.\n\n* A new `ShaderCache` class is provided to ensure that identical shaders are only compiled once and no unnecessary examination and/or checks are done on already compiled WebGL shader and program objects, which significantly accelerates app start up under some occasions.\n\n\n### Documentation Improvements\n\nComplete rewrite of luma.gl's documentation. New structure and contents for every classes provided, featured on a new website with links to other frameworks in Uber's visualization framework suite, such as deck.gl and react-map-gl.\n\n\n### Code Size Improvements\n\nSignificant reduction in the size of distributed luma.gl library\n\n* Code Size - luma.gl is continuously being tuned for code size.\n* Deprecated Code Removed - Removal of deprecated features to help reduce library size.\n* Tree Shaking support - special care have been taken to avoid so called \"side effects\" that defeat dependency analysis during tree shaking).\n\n\n## v3.0\n\nRelease Date: March 15, 2017\n\nA smaller release mainly intended to align the luma.gl code base with the big deck.gl v4 release.\n\n## Major News\n\n### Examples\n\n* Examples converted to ES6 to better showcase the luma.gl API.\n\n\n## Debug Support\n\n* Now uses `WEBGL_debug_shaders` extension when available to log translated shader source code.\n* Performance queries, using `EXT_disjoint_timer_query` and `EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2` to provide timings.\n\n\n## New `AnimationFrame` class\n\n* Wraps requestAnimationFrame on browser and Node.js\n* Supports initialization promises (wait for HTML body (canvas) to load, wait for texture images to load, etc).\n* Supplies common uniforms to the frame render function: `width`, `height`, `aspect`, `tick`, `time` etc.\n\n\n## Smaller changes\n\n* Fix glTypeToArray to use `Uint8ClampedArrays` by default\n* Add CORS setting to allow loading image from a different domain\n\n## New `gl-matrix` based math library\n\n* Optional library: All math operations directly accept JavaScript arrays\n* Math classes are subclasses of JavaScript arrays (i.e. not {x,y,z} objects)\n  and can thus be used interchangeably with arrays.\n* Relies on `gl-matrix` for computations.\n* Adds optional error checking.\n* Offers more control over details like printing precision etc.\n\n### Library Size\n\n* Reorganized to only export a minimal surface of functions/classes.\n* Tree-shaking support (package.json module keyword and dist-es6 distribution)\n* Significant reduction of module dependencies.\n\n### Experimental APIs\n\n* `shader-modules`, `shader-tools`, `shaders` shader module system added to `/experimental`\n* `probe` moved to `/experimental`\n\n### Deprecations/Deletions\n\n* Old math lib deprecated.\n* `FBO` class deprecated (use `Framebuffer` directly).\n* `Camera` class deprecated, use math library directly.\n* `Scene` class deprecated, for effects use - TBD\n\n### Internal improvements\n\n* Replace wildcard exports with named exports in index.js\n* ES6 Conformant code base: stage-2 extensions removed\n* Webpack based build\n* Multiple examples now work standalone\n* Experimental tree-shaking support: dist and dist-es6 directories\n* Dependency removal, including removal of `autobind-decorator` dependency\n* Changed precommit hook from `husky` to `pre-commit`\n* `webgl` folder now contains both webgl1 and webgl2 classes\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n* BREAKING CHANGE: Move node IO (loadImage etc) out of main src tree and into `packages`.

This should simplify build and setup for applications that don't use headless-gl.\n\n### Improve change detection\n\n* Redraw flag management improvements\n* New experimental Renderer class - `requestAnimationFrame` replacement.\n\n\n## v1.0\n\nRelease Date: 2016\n\nTheme: A smaller, mostly internal version that was the starting point for luma.gl development.\n\n### Major Features\n\n* Initial ES6 Port from PhiloGL\n","slug":"docs/whats-new","title":"What's New"},{"excerpt":"Bundling Optimizing for Bundle Size luma.gl and luma.gl provide a lot of functionality and the amount of code these libraries contain will…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Bundling\n\n## Optimizing for Bundle Size\n\nluma.gl and luma.gl provide a lot of functionality and the amount of code these libraries contain will of course impact the size of your application bundle and your startup load time.\n\nThere are multiple techniques used in JavaScript.\n\n\n### Choosing a dist folder\n\nWhen installed from npm, luma.gl and related libraries come with three separate `dist` sub folders.\n\n| Folder     | `mainField` | Description   |\n| ---        | ---         | --- |\n| `dist/es6` | `esnext`    | The most compact distribution is with very few exceptions essentially untranspiled ES6/ES2015 code (via `babel-preset-env`). This is the smallest distribution, and is the best choice if you are only targeting modern \"evergreen\" browsers (e.g. not IE11 or older mobile devices). |\n| `dist/esm` | `module`    | Same as `dist/es5`, except `export` and `import` statements are left untranspiled to enable tree shaking. The main reason to use this distribution is if your are targeting older browsers (e.g. IE11 or older mobile devices). |\n| `dist/es5` | `main`      | All code is transpiled into ES5 and exports/imports are transpiled into `commonjs` requires. The main reason to use this distribution is if your bundler does not support tree-shaking using `import`/`export` syntax. |\n\nYou will have to check the documentation of your particular bundler to see what configuration options are available:\n\n* Webpack 2 and later will pick the `esm` distribution by default (the `module` main field)\n* Webpack 4 allows you to choose the `esnext` distribution by specifying a new `resolve.mainFields` array in your application's webpack config.\n* For other bundlers, please refer to the respective documentation to see if you can control which distribution to use. If not, expect the `es5` distribution to be used.\n\n\n### About Tree-Shaking\n\nluma.gl is designed to fully leverage tree-shaking. Tree-shaking should be possible with any supporting browser but development has currentle focusing on enabling the webpack 4 + babel 7 combination which provides excellent results.\n\nSome things to be aware of when working with tree-shaking:\n\n* At least in Webpack, tree shaking is done by the uglifier, which is typically only run as the very last step on production builds. This means that it is typically not possible to assess the benefits of tree shaking during development.\n* The lack of tree-shaking during development makes it hard to make statements about bundle size impact of a library just from looking at bundle sizes of development builds or the size of the library's npm module. Our recommendation is to always measure impact on your actual production builds.\n\n\n### Pay for What you Use\n\nNaturally, an application that uses all the functionality offered by a framework will benefit little from tree shaking, whereas a small app that only uses a few selected components should expect big savings.\n\nWhen we modularize luma.gl, we are less focused on the size of the entire library, and more on making sure that applications only pay for the features they actually use. Also we try to make the core set of functionality small.\n\n\n### Bundle Size Numbers\n\nSo, what kind of impact on bundle sizes should you expect when using luma.gl? When do you know if you have set up your bundler optimally. To help answer these questions, we provide some numbers you can compare against. luma.gl has scripts that measure the size of a minified bundle after each build, which allows us to provide comparison numbers between releases. This bundle imports the `Module` and `AnimationLoop` classes, which are the basic building blocks of most apps.\n\n| es6-production  | 6.1 Bundle/Zip | 6.0 Bundle/Zip |\n| ---             | ---            | ---            |\n| es6-production  | 144KB  / 42KB  | 181KB  / 51KB  |\n| esm-production  | 209KB  / 49KB  | 281KB  / 66KB  |\n| es5-production  | 408KB  / 88KB  | 422KB  / 93KB  |\n| es6-development | 787KB  / 123KB | 926KB  / 165KB |\n| esm-development | 1048KB / 150KB | 1167KB / 192KB |\n| es5-development | 961KB  / 142KB | 1052KB / 182KB |\n\n\n* Numbers represent the minified bundle size of a minimal application, bundled with Webpack 4, which means that the `ES6` and ESM numbers benefit from tree shaking.\n* The number in parenthesis are the compressed bundle sizes. This is an indication of the how much extra size will be added to your compressed app bundle if you import luma.gl.\n* For the ES6 and ESM dists, apps that use more luma.gl classes and features will see an increase in bundle size.\n\n\n### Future Work\n\nThis is not the final word on luma.gl bundle size. More work is being done to reduce the size of luma.gl and we are confident that even as fture releases will have more functionality, we will be able to keep the library code from growing and, more importantly, make luma.gl even more \"tree shakeable\", with the intention that apps should only \"pay for what they use\".\n\n\n## Remarks\n\n* **Optimizing for minified code** - Due to inclusion of sourcemaps etc, the bundle size impact of luma.gl tends to look more significant in development builds than in the final production builds. While reducing the size of the development libraries is also desirable, the current goal is to ensure the impact of adding luma.gl on the final, minified/uglified application bundle is as small as possible.\n* Compressed bundle sizes are calculated using `gzip -9`. Consider using slower `brotli` compression for static assests, it typically provides an additional 20% reduction.\n","slug":"docs/developer-guide/bundling","title":"Bundling"},{"excerpt":"Development Environment To get started developing luma.gl, first make sure to install all dependancies from the repository root:  luma.gl's…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Development Environment\n\nTo get started developing luma.gl, first make sure to install all dependancies from the repository root:\n\n`yarn bootstrap`\n\nluma.gl's source code is in the `modules/` directory. Development is most easily done by running the examples in development mode, e.g.:\n\n```\ncd examples/core/instancing\nyarn\nyarn start-local\n```\n\nAny modifications made to the source or example code will cause the example to rebuild and the page to refresh, making quick iterations on code changes straightforward.\n\nTesting against the full website can be done by running `yarn start` in the the `website/`. This full website take longer to build but makes it easier to test against all examples. This can be helpful when making core changes to luma.gl. As with running the examples in development mode, a rebuild and page refresh will be triggered whenever source or website code is updated.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting is performed on Travis CI and using a precommit hook. Local testing is supported on these environments:\n\n* `yarn test` - runs tests under node using headless.gl and a headless Chrome instance (using [SwiftShader](https://github.com/google/swiftshader)).\n* `yarn test browser` - Tests in your browser, may be helpful to quickly debug test case failures since it autoreloads on changes and gives you full access to your browser's debugger.\n\nWhen adding new features, please add relevant unit tests to the `test/` directory in the relevant module.\n\n### Helpful Hints\n- To only run one test from the suite for debugging purposes, change a call to `test` in the relevant spec to `test.only`. Remember to change this back before committing!\n- If a test fails in `headless`, but not in the browser, it's likely due to a difference in the contexts created (WebGL 1 versus 2), or the extensions available. Running in a browser without WebGL 2 support (e.g. Safari), might help narrow the issue down.\n","slug":"docs/contributor-guide","title":"Development Environment"},{"excerpt":"Hello Instancing (High-level) In this tutorial, we'll work through how to do instanced drawing with luma.gl's high-level APIs. We'll also…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Hello Instancing (High-level)\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll work through how to do instanced drawing with luma.gl's high-level APIs. We'll also take this opportunity to introduce luma.gl shader modules. We'll begin with our [hello triangle](./hello-triangle.md) app and make some modifications. First let's create a shader module:\n```js\nimport {AnimationLoop, Model} from '@luma.gl/engine';\nimport {Buffer, clear} from '@luma.gl/webgl';\n\nconst colorShaderModule = {\n  name: 'color',\n  vs: `\n    varying vec3 color_vColor;\n\n    void color_setColor(vec3 color) {\n      color_vColor = color;\n    }\n  `,\n  fs: `\n    varying vec3 color_vColor;\n\n    vec3 color_getColor() {\n      return color_vColor;\n    }\n  `\n};\n```\n\nA shader module is essentially just some GLSL code that will be inserted into our vertex and fragment shaders. They're usually used to define functions that implement generic functionality that can be reused in different programs. In this case, we're defining one to simply pass a color from the vertex shader to the fragment shader in a varying. This module also demonstrates a common convention in luma.gl to prefix function and variable names in a shader module with the name of the module to avoid name collisions.\n\nNow let's update our vertex and fragment shaders to use the module functions:\n```js\nconst vs = `\n  attribute vec2 position;\n  attribute vec3 color;\n\n  void main() {\n    color_setColor(color);\n    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n  }\n`;\n\nconst fs = `\n  void main() {\n    gl_FragColor = vec4(color_getColor(), 1.0);\n  }\n`;\n```\n\nNow we update the `Model` to use the module:\n```js\nconst model = new Model(gl, {\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  modules: [colorShaderModule],\n  attributes: {\n    position: positionBuffer,\n    color: colorBuffer\n  },\n  vertexCount: 3\n});\n```\n\nIf you rerun the app, it should render as it did before.\n\nNow let's add some instancing to this scene! First we'll modify the position and color buffers we created before, and add an offset buffer to set the position of each instance:\n```js\nconst positionBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n  -0.2, -0.2,\n  0.2, -0.2,\n  0.0, 0.2\n]));\n\nconst colorBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n  1.0, 0.0, 0.0,\n  0.0, 1.0, 0.0,\n  0.0, 0.0, 1.0,\n  1.0, 1.0, 0.0\n]));\n\nconst offsetBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n  0.5, 0.5,\n  -0.5, 0.5,\n  0.5,  -0.5,\n  -0.5, -0.5\n]));\n```\nFor this scene, the positions are vertex attributes, while the colors and offsets are instance attributes.\n\nNow add the offsets to the vertex shader:\n```js\nconst vs = `\n  attribute vec2 position;\n  attribute vec3 color;\n  attribute vec2 offset;\n\n  void main() {\n    color_setColor(color);\n    gl_Position = vec4(position + offset, 0.0, 1.0);\n  }\n`;\n```\n\nFinally, we need to add the new buffer to the `Model`, and describe the parameters of the instanced draw:\n```js\nconst model = new Model(gl, {\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  modules: [colorShaderModule],\n  attributes: {\n    position: positionBuffer,\n    color: [colorBuffer, {divisor: 1}],\n    offset: [offsetBuffer, {divisor: 1}]\n  },\n  vertexCount: 3,\n  instanceCount: 4\n});\n```\nNote the new syntax used for the attributes. The second element in each array is an `accessor` that describes how the buffer should be traversed during a draw. luma.gl will try to infer these parameters from the data or the shader when possible, but when it can't (or when we want to override the inferred values), we have to provide an explicit accessor. We also provide the model with the number of instances we want to draw.\n\nIf all went well, running the app now should draw four triangles, each a different color. For reference the complete code is provided below:\n```js\nimport {AnimationLoop, Model} from '@luma.gl/engine';\nimport {Buffer, clear} from '@luma.gl/webgl';\n\nconst colorShaderModule = {\n  name: 'color',\n  vs: `\n    varying vec3 color_vColor;\n\n    void color_setColor(vec3 color) {\n      color_vColor = color;\n    }\n  `,\n  fs: `\n    varying vec3 color_vColor;\n\n    vec3 color_getColor() {\n      return color_vColor;\n    }\n  `\n};\n\nconst loop = new AnimationLoop({\n  onInitialize({gl}) {\n    const positionBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n      -0.2, -0.2,\n      0.2, -0.2,\n      0.0, 0.2\n    ]));\n\n    const colorBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n      1.0, 0.0, 0.0,\n      0.0, 1.0, 0.0,\n      0.0, 0.0, 1.0,\n      1.0, 1.0, 0.0\n    ]));\n\n    const offsetBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n      0.5, 0.5,\n      -0.5, 0.5,\n      0.5,  -0.5,\n      -0.5, -0.5\n    ]));\n\n    const model = new Model(gl, {\n      vs: `\n        attribute vec2 position;\n        attribute vec3 color;\n        attribute vec2 offset;\n\n        void main() {\n          color_setColor(color);\n          gl_Position = vec4(position + offset, 0.0, 1.0);\n        }\n      `,\n      fs: `\n        void main() {\n          gl_FragColor = vec4(color_getColor(), 1.0);\n        }\n      `,\n      modules: [colorShaderModule],\n      attributes: {\n        position: positionBuffer,\n        color: [colorBuffer, {divisor: 1}],\n        offset: [offsetBuffer, {divisor: 1}]\n      },\n      vertexCount: 3,\n      instanceCount: 4,\n      instanced: true\n    });\n\n    return {model};\n  },\n\n  onRender({gl, model}) {\n    clear(gl, {color: [0, 0, 0, 1]});\n    model.draw();\n  }\n});\n\nloop.start();\n\n```\n","slug":"docs/get-started/hello-instancing-high","title":"Hello Instancing (High-level)"},{"excerpt":"Shader Modules Overview shadertools is a GLSL shader module system built around a GLSL \"assembler\" that allows you build modular shaders. It…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Shader Modules\n\n## Overview\n\nshadertools is a GLSL shader module system built around a GLSL \"assembler\" that allows you build modular shaders. It addresses the lack of a module/import system in the GLSL language and allows you to import chunks of reusable shader code from modules into your shader source code, and organize your shader code in reusable modules.\n\n* Enables you to import and \"inject\" prepackaged modules of shader code into your shaders.\n* Allows you to package up reusable GLSL code as shader modules.\n* Adds GPU detection and a measure of portability your shaders.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo add/inject existing modules into your shaders, just add the modules parameter to your `assembleShaders` call:\n\n```js\nimport {shaderModule} from 'library-of-shader-modules';\nconst {vs, fs, getUniforms, moduleMap} = assembleShaders(gl, {\n  fs: '...',\n  vs: '...',\n  modules: [shaderModule],\n  ...\n})\n```\n\nTo create a new shader module, you need to create a descriptor object.\n\n```js\nconst MY_SHADER_MODULE = {\n  name: 'my-shader-module',\n  vs: ....\n  fs: null,\n  dependencies: [],\n  deprecations: [],\n  getUniforms\n};\n```\n\nThis object can be used as shader module directly:\n\n```js\nassembleShaders(gl, {..., modules: [MY_SHADER_MODULE]});\n```\n\n## Structure of a Shader Module\n\n### Shader Module Type\n\nA shader module is either:\n\n* **Generic** - a set of generic GLSL functions that can be included either in a fragment shader or a vertex shader (or both). The `fp64` module is a good example of this type of module.\n* **Functional** - Contains specific vertex and/or fragment shader \"chunks\", often set up so that the vertex shader part sets up a `varying` used by the fragment shader part.\n\n\n### Shader Module Descriptor\n\nTo define a new shader module, you create a descriptor object that brings together all the necessary pieces:\n\n```js\nexport const MY_SHADER_MODULE = {\n  name: 'my-shader-module',\n  vs: '...',\n  fs: '...',\n  dependencies: [],\n  deprecations: [],\n  getUniforms\n};\n```\n\nDescriptor objects can define the following fields:\n\n* `name` (*String*, Required) - The name of the shader module.\n* `vs` - (String | null)\n* `fs` - (String | null)\n* `getUniforms` JavaScript function that maps JavaScript parameter keys to uniforms used by this module\n* `uniforms` (*Object*) - a light alternative to `getUniforms`, see below\n* `dependencies` (*Array*) - a list of other shader modules that this module is dependent on\n* `deprecations` (*Array*) - a list of deprecated APIs.\n\nIf `deprecations` is supplied, `assembleShaders` will scan GLSL source code for the deprecated constructs and issue a console warning if found. Each API is described in the following format:\n  - `type`: `uniform <type>` or `function`\n  - `old`: name of the deprecated uniform/function\n  - `new`: name of the new uniform/function\n  - `deprecated`: whether the old API is still supported.\n\n\n### GLSL Code\n\nThe GLSL code for a shader module typically contains:\n\n* a mix of uniform and varying declarations\n* one or more GLSL function definitions\n\n\n### getUniforms\n\nEach shader module provides a method to get a map of uniforms for the shader. This function will be called with two arguments:\n\n* `opts` - the module settings to update. This argument may not be provided when `getUniforms` is called to generate a set of default uniform values.\n* `context` - the uniforms generated by this module's dependencies.\n\nThe function should return a JavaScript object with keys representing uniform names and values representing uniform values.\n\nThe function should expect the shape of the dependency uniforms to vary based on what's passed in `opts`. This behavior is intended because we only want to recalculate a uniform if the uniforms that it depends on are changed. An example is the `project` and `project64` modules in deck.gl. When `opts.viewport` is provided, `project64` will receive the updated projection matrix generated by the `project` module. If `opts.viewport` is empty, then the `project` module generates nothing and so should `project64`.\n\n\n### uniforms\n\nIf the uniforms of this module can be directly pulled from user settings, they may declaratively defined by a `uniforms` object:\n\n```js\n{\n  name: 'my-shader-module',\n  uniforms: {\n    strength: {type: 'number', value: 1, min: 0, max: 1},\n    center: [0.5, 0.5]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAt runtime, this map will be used to generate the uniforms needed by the shaders. If either `strength` or `center` is present in the user's module settings, then the user's value will be used; otherwise, the default value in the original definition will be used.\n\nEach uniform definition may contain the following fields:\n\n* `type` (*String*) - one of `number`, `boolean`, `array` or `object`\n* `value` - the default value of this uniform\n\nWith `type: 'number'`, the following additional fields may be added for validation:\n\n* `min` (*Number*)\n* `max` (*Number*)\n\nNote: `uniforms` is ignored if `getUniforms` is provided.\n\n## GLSL Syntax Conversion Reference\n\nWhere possible, the shader assembler replaces keywords based on the version of the shader into which a module is inserted. While not all GLSL ES 3.0 features can be emulated, this allows many modules to be used across versions.\n\nSyntax replacement tables are provided below:\n\nVertex Shaders\n\n| 3.00 ES         | 1.00 ES     | Comment         |\n| ---             | ---         | ---             |\n| `in`            | `attribute` |                 |\n| `out`           | `varying`   |                 |\n\nFragment Shaders\n\n| 3.00 ES         | 1.00 ES        | Comment |\n| ---             | ---            | ---     |\n| `in`            | `varying`      |         |\n| `out`           | `gl_FragColor` |         |\n| `out`           | `gl_FragData`  |         |\n| `texture`       | `texture2D`    | `texture` will be replaced with `texture2D` to ensure 1.00 code is correct. See note on `textureCube` below. |\n| `textureCube` * | `textureCube`  | `textureCube` is not valid 3.00 syntax, but must be used to ensure 1.00 code is correct, because `texture` will be substituted with `texture2D` when transpiled to 100.

This essentially means writing our app using the WebGL API directly, using only a few low-level helper functions to manage shaders and polyfilling. We'll need to install the `gltools` module so we can get a polyfilled context without the `AnimationLoop`:\n```bash\nnpm i @luma.gl/gltools\n```\n\nNow we can update the imports:\n```js\nimport {assembleShaders} from '@luma.gl/shadertools';\nimport {polyfillContext} from '@luma.gl/gltools';\n```\n\nSince we aren't using the `AnimationLoop`, we'll create our canvas and get a WebGL context directly:\n```js\nconst canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\ncanvas.width = 800;\ncanvas.height = 600;\ndocument.body.appendChild(canvas);\n\nconst gl = polyfillContext(canvas.getContext(\"webgl\"));\ngl.clearColor(0, 0, 0, 1);\n```\nNote that we're creating a WebGL 1 context here.

Creating our program is *a little* more verbose than before:\n```js\nconst colorShaderModule = {\n  name: 'color',\n  vs: `\n    varying vec3 color_vColor;\n\n    void color_setColor(vec3 color) {\n      color_vColor = color;\n    }\n  `,\n  fs: `\n    varying vec3 color_vColor;\n\n    vec3 color_getColor() {\n      return color_vColor;\n    }\n  `\n};\n\nconst vs = `\n  attribute vec2 position;\n  attribute vec3 color;\n  attribute vec2 offset;\n\n  void main() {\n    color_setColor(color);\n    gl_Position = vec4(position + offset, 0.0, 1.0);\n  }\n`;\nconst fs = `\n  void main() {\n    gl_FragColor = vec4(color_getColor(), 1.0);\n  }\n`;\n\nconst assembled = assembleShaders(gl, {\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  modules: [colorShaderModule]\n});\n\nconst vShader = gl.createShader(gl.VERTEX_SHADER);\ngl.shaderSource(vShader, assembled.vs);\ngl.compileShader(vShader);\n\nconst fShader = gl.createShader(gl.FRAGMENT_SHADER);\ngl.shaderSource(fShader, assembled.fs);\ngl.compileShader(fShader);\n\nconst program = gl.createProgram();\ngl.attachShader(program, vShader);\ngl.attachShader(program, fShader);\ngl.linkProgram(program);\n```\n\nNext we'll create our vertex array:\n```js\nconst vertexArray = gl.createVertexArray();\ngl.bindVertexArray(vertexArray);\n```\nWait a minute... we're calling `createVertexArray` and `bindVertexArray` on a WebGL 1 context. But those functions aren't part of the WebGL 1 API! How is this working? The function `polyfillContext` that we used when creating our context will use WebGL extensions that are available to implement WebGL 2 functions on a WebGL 1 context. So we can just program against the WebGL 2 API!\n\nWell... mostly... Polyfilling will only work if the necessary extensions are available. And some WebGL 2 features like occlusion queries and transform feedback simply aren't supported by polyfills.\n\nMoving on... setting up the vertex array, concise as always in WebGL:\n```js\nconst vertexArray = gl.createVertexArray();\ngl.bindVertexArray(vertexArray);\n\nconst positionBuffer = gl.createBuffer();\ngl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBuffer);\ngl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([\n  -0.2, -0.2,\n  0.2, -0.2,\n  0.0, 0.2\n]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);\n\nconst positionLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(program, \"position\");\ngl.vertexAttribPointer(positionLocation, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);\ngl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionLocation);\n\nconst colorBuffer = gl.createBuffer();\ngl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, colorBuffer);\ngl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([\n  1.0, 0.0, 0.0,\n  0.0, 1.0, 0.0,\n  0.0, 0.0, 1.0,\n  1.0, 1.0, 0.0\n]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);\n\nconst colorLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(program, \"color\");\ngl.vertexAttribPointer(colorLocation, 3, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);\ngl.vertexAttribDivisor(colorLocation, 1);\ngl.enableVertexAttribArray(colorLocation);\n\nconst offsetBuffer = gl.createBuffer();\ngl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, offsetBuffer);\ngl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([\n  0.5, 0.5,\n  -0.5, 0.5,\n  0.5,  -0.5,\n  -0.5, -0.5\n]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);\n\nconst offsetLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(program, \"offset\");\ngl.vertexAttribPointer(offsetLocation, 2, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);\ngl.vertexAttribDivisor(offsetLocation, 1);\ngl.enableVertexAttribArray(offsetLocation);\n\ngl.bindVertexArray(null);\n```\n\nAnd then we set up our draw loop:\n```js\nrequestAnimationFrame(function draw() {\n  requestAnimationFrame(draw);\n\n  gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n  gl.bindVertexArray(vertexArray);\n  gl.useProgram(program);\n  gl.drawArraysInstanced(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 3, 4);\n});\n```\n\nIf all went well, you should see the same scene as drawn by the high- and mid-level apps: four triangles of different colors. We simply used luma.gl's `shadertools` and `gltools` to provide polyfilled instanced drawing and compose our shaders from modules.

First we need to install the `shadertools` module so we can compose shaders without the `Model` class:\n```bash\nnpm i @luma.gl/shadertools\n```\n\nNow we can update the imports:\n```js\nimport {AnimationLoop} from '@luma.gl/engine';\nimport {Program, VertexArray, Buffer, clear} from '@luma.gl/webgl';\nimport {assembleShaders} from '@luma.gl/shadertools';\n```\nMost of the initialization is similar, but we'll replace the creation of `Model` with its individual parts: shader composition, a vertex array, and a program. Shader composition is handled by `assembleShaders`\n```js\nconst assembled = assembleShaders(gl, {\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  modules: [colorShaderModule]\n});\n```\n\nWe can then use the assembled shaders to create a `Program`:\n```js\nconst program = new Program(gl, assembled);\n```\n\nThe attributes for the draw are managed by a `VertexArray`:\n```js\nconst vertexArray = new VertexArray(gl, {\n  program,\n  attributes: {\n    position: positionBuffer,\n    color: [colorBuffer, {divisor: 1}],\n    offset: [offsetBuffer, {divisor: 1}]\n  }\n});\n```\nThe `VertexArray` takes the `program` as an argument to infer attribute parameters.\n\nThe `vertexArray` and `program` are required for drawing, so we'll return them from `onInitialize`, and then use them in `onRender`:\n```js\nonInitialize({gl}) {\n  // Setup...\n\n  return {program, vertexArray};\n}\n\nonRender({gl, program, vertexArray}) {\n  clear(gl, {color: [0, 0, 0, 1]});\n  program.draw({\n    vertexArray,\n    vertexCount: 3,\n    instanceCount: 4\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThe scene should be identical to the one draw with the high-level API.

It is assumed you've set up your development environment as described in [Getting Started](./README.md). Your `index.js` file should look like the following:\n\n```js\nimport {AnimationLoop} from '@luma.gl/engine';\nimport {clear} from '@luma.gl/webgl';\n\nconst loop = new AnimationLoop({\n  onInitialize({gl}) {\n    // Setup logic goes here\n  },\n\n  onRender({gl}) {\n    // Drawing logic goes here\n    clear(gl, {color: [0, 0, 0, 1]});\n  }\n});\n\nloop.start();\n```\n\nFirst, we'll need to update our imports with the classes we'll be using, `Buffer` and `Model`:\n```js\nimport {AnimationLoop, Model} from '@luma.gl/engine';\nimport {Buffer, clear} from '@luma.gl/webgl';\n```\n\nNow let's create some buffers in the `onInitialize` method to hold our attribute data:\n```js\n  onInitialize({gl}) {\n    // Setup logic goes here\n    const positionBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n      -0.5, -0.5,\n      0.5, -0.5,\n      0.0, 0.5\n    ]));\n\n    const colorBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([\n      1.0, 0.0, 0.0,\n      0.0, 1.0, 0.0,\n      0.0, 0.0, 1.0\n    ]));\n  }\n```\nNext let's add the vertex and fragment shader code we'll be using to draw:\n```js\n  onInitialize({gl}) {\n    // Setup logic goes here\n\n    // Buffers...\n\n    const vs = `\n      attribute vec2 position;\n      attribute vec3 color;\n\n      varying vec3 vColor;\n\n      void main() {\n        vColor = color;\n        gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n      }\n    `;\n\n    const fs = `\n      varying vec3 vColor;\n\n      void main() {\n        gl_FragColor = vec4(vColor, 1.0);\n      }\n    `;\n\n  }\n```\n\nAs a final step in our initialization, we'll create a `Model` and return it from `onInitialize`:\n\n```js\n  onInitialize({gl}) {\n    // Setup logic goes here\n\n    // Buffers...\n\n    // Shaders...\n\n    const model = new Model(gl, {\n      vs,\n      fs,\n      attributes: {\n        position: positionBuffer,\n        color: colorBuffer\n      },\n      vertexCount: 3\n    });\n\n    return {model};\n  }\n```\nA `Model` can be thought of as gathering all the WebGL pieces necessary for a single draw call: programs, attributes, uniforms. Also note that we return the `Model` instance we created. This will make it available to the `onRender` method.\n\nOur `onRender` method is comparitavely much simpler:\n```js\n  onRender({gl, model}) {\n    clear(gl, {color: [0, 0, 0, 1]});\n    model.draw();\n  }\n```\nThis clears the canvas and draws the `Model`.

Applications use transform feedback to data processing from CPU to GPU, where multiple parallel execution units will be used for processing. Data is handled in form of `Buffer` objects, i.e. data resides in the GPU memory.\n\nTransform Feedback operations write their output into `Buffer` instances. These buffers can then be directly set as attributes on `Model` or `VertexArray` for regular rendering operations.\n\nBuffers can be read back to the CPU, but this has a high performance penaltyh. Ideally, the application's logic can be designed so that CPU access is not required which avoids expensive CPU and GPU sync.\n\nTo run a single transform feedback operation:\n\n* Create a `Program` or a `Model` with varyings (`out` variables) declared in the vertex shader's GLSL code, and provide the names of these varyings to the `Program` constructor.\n* Use `Program.draw()` or `Model.draw()` with a `transformFeedback` parameter.\n* `Model.transform()` is equivalent to `Model.draw()` but automatically turns off the fragment shader stage.\n\nAlternatively, the more powerful `Transform` class is preferable if you don't want to deal with setting up `Program` and `TransformFeedback` instances, or if intend to run a repeating, double buffered transform feedback loop.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport {Transform} from '@luma.gl/core';\n```\n\n### Use case : Specify source and destination buffers.\n\nCreate a `Transform` object by passing, vs (vertex shader), source buffer(s), varyings (output variable names in vertex shader) and destination buffers. Then call `run` to perform one transform feedback iteration.\n\n```js\nconst VS = `\\\n#version 300 es\nattribute float inValue;\nvarying float outValue;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n  outValue = 2.0 * inValue;\n}\n`;\n\nconst sourceData = new Float32Array([10, 20, 31, 0, -57]);\nconst sourceBuffer = new Buffer(gl, {data: sourceData});\n\n// Default values applied for size (1) and type (gl.FLOAT)\nconst feedbackBuffer = new Buffer(gl, {byteLength: sourceData.length * 4});\n\nconst transform = new Transform(gl2, {\n  sourceBuffers: {\n    inValue: sourceBuffer\n  },\n  feedbackBuffers: {\n    outValue: feedbackBuffer\n  },\n  vs: VS,\n  varyings: ['outValue'],\n  elementCount: 5\n});\n\n// Perform one transform feedback iteration\ntransform.run();\n```\n\n### Use case : Create destination buffers automatically.\n\n`Transform` can internally create destination buffers (i.e. feedback buffers), when `feedbackMap` is provided. Each destination buffer is created with same settings and layout as corresponding source buffer as per `feedbackMap`.\n\n```js\nconst transform = new Transform(gl2, {\n  sourceBuffers: {\n    inValue: sourceBuffer\n  },\n  feedbackMap: {\n    inValue: 'outValue'\n  },\n  vs: VS,\n  varyings: ['outValue'],\n  elementCount: 5\n});\n\n```\n### Use case : Multiple iterations using swap().\n\nWhen `feedbackMap` is specified buffers can be swapped using a single call to `swap()`, this is useful for cases like particle simulation, where output of one transform feedback iteration is piped as input to the next iteration.\n\n```js\n\n// Setup Transform with `souceDestinationMap` as above\n\ntransform.run();\n\nlet bufferWithNewValues = transform.getBuffer('outValue');\n...\n// Render using 'bufferWithNewValues'\n...\n\n//swap buffers\ntransform.swap();\ntransform.run();\nbufferWithNewValues = transform.getBuffer('outValue');\n...\n// Render using 'bufferWithNewValues'\n...\n```\n\n### Use case : Update one or more buffers using update() method..\n\nOnce `Transform` object is constructed and used, one or more source or destination buffers can be updated using `update`.\n\n```js\n// transform is set up as above\n...\n\n// update buffer binding for 'inValue' attribute\nconst newSourceBuffer = new Buffer(gl, {data: newSourceData});\ntransform.update({\n  sourceBuffers: {\n    inValue: newSourceBuffer\n  }\n});\n\n// now data is provided from newly bound buffer.\ntransform.run();\n```\n","slug":"docs/developer-guide/transform-feedback","title":"Transform Feedback (WebGL2)"},{"excerpt":"Getting Started This tutorial will walk you through setting up a basic development environment for luma.gl applications using webpack.

To make sure everything works, let's add a draw command:\n```js\nimport {AnimationLoop} from '@luma.gl/engine';\nimport {clear} from '@luma.gl/webgl';\n\nconst loop = new AnimationLoop({\n  onInitialize({gl}) {\n    // Setup logic goes here\n  },\n\n  onRender({gl}) {\n    // Drawing logic goes here\n    clear(gl, {color: [0, 0, 0, 1]});\n  }\n});\n\nloop.start();\n```\nand run\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\nfrom the command line. If all went well, a tab should open in your default browser, and you should see a black rectangle at the top left of your screen.\n","slug":"docs/get-started","title":"Getting Started"},{"excerpt":"What's Next?

To dig deeper into luma.gl's API, we recommend playing around with the examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/uber/luma.gl/tree/master/examples/core) of the repository, which demonstrate various parts of the API in more detail. They can also be browsed on the [website](https://luma.gl/examples).\n\nTo run the examples, clone the repo and run the examples from their directory:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:uber/luma.gl.git\ncd luma.gl/examples/core/instancing\ngit checkout 8.0-release\nyarn\nyarn start\n```\n\nThis will start a local development server and open the page in your browser. The main application code is in `app.js` and the page will automatically refresh whenever it's udpated.\n\nNote that we checkout the latest release branch here (`8.0-release`), which is recommended as `master` the active developmentment branch.\n","slug":"docs/get-started/whats-next","title":"What's Next?"},{"excerpt":"High, Medium, Low luma.gl is designed to provide support for development at whatever level the user requires.

This can roughly be split into three levels of abstraction:\n- Low-level: Program directly with the WebGL API with some lightweight tools for managing the gl context, shaders and debugging. This will primarily involve using the `shadertools`, `gltools` and `debug` modules.\n- Mid-level: Program with convenient wrapper classes around the WebGL API. This involves using the `webgl` module.\n- High-level: Program using 3D engine constructs like models or resource managers. This primarily involves using the `engine` and `webgl` modules.\n\nTo demonstrate how luma.gl functions at these three levels, we'll implement the same scene, 4 instanced colored triangles, three times, once at each level of abstraction.\n","slug":"docs/get-started/high-medium-low","title":"High, Medium, Low"},{"excerpt":"Parameter Setting luma.gl simplifies the usage of WebGL parameters by providing a unified API for setting and getting values. Any GL…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Parameter Setting\n\nluma.gl simplifies the usage of WebGL parameters by providing a unified API for setting and getting values. Any GL parameter can be queried or set using `getParameters` and `setParameters` (no need to keep track of what underlying WebGL calls are required), and luma.gl also provide *setting names* that allow the normal WebGL setter functions (like `gl.blendEquation` or `gl.clearColor`) to be specified as keys in a `setParameters` call.\n\nIn addition, state queries are done towards cached values and are thus much faster than working directly with the WebGL API, where synchronous WebGL queries can be a performance bottleneck.\n\nThe following functions are provided:\n* `getParameters` - Returns the values of some or all GL context parameters\n* `setParameters` - Sets a the value(s) of the specified GL context parameters\n* `resetParameters` - Resets all gl context parameters to default values\n\n## Usage\n\nSet a global parameter value using a WebGL GLenum\n```js\nconst value = setParameters(gl, {\n  [gl.DEPTH_TEST]: true\n});\n```\n\nSet a global parameter value using a luma.gl setting function name\n```js\nconst value = setParameters(gl, {\n  depthTest: true\n});\n```\n\nGet all gl parameter values (values will be an object map keyed with parameter names)\n```js\nconst values = getParameters(gl);\n```\n\n## Functions\n\n### getParameters\n\nGets the values of a gl context parameter.\n\n```js\ngetParameters(gl, values)\n```\n\n* `gl` {WebGLRenderingContext} - context\n* `values`= {Object | GLenum[] | null}  - parameters, either as keys in object or elements of array. Defaults to all parameters.\nReturns {Object} - object with keys and values corresponding to supplied parameter names and the current values of those parameters.\n\n\n### setParameters\n\nSets a number of parameters.\n\n```js\nsetParameters(gl, {key: value, ...})\n```\n\n* `gl` {WebGLRenderingContext} - context\n* `key` {String} - parameter names, (, either )luma.gl setting name or a GL parameter constants\n* `value` {*} - parameter value\nReturns {*} - \"normalized\" parameter value after assignment\n\nNote:\n* If both luma.gl setting names and GL parameter constants representing the same value are submitted the results are undefined.\n* value may be \"normalized\" (in case a short form is supported). In that case the normalized value is returned.\n\n### resetParameters\n\n```js\nresetParameters(gl)\n```\nResets all gl context parameters to default values.\n\n* `gl` {WebGLRenderingContext} - context\nReturns no value.\n\nNote that technically, resetting context parameters does not fully reset the context, as buffer binding, z buffer values etc are not reset.\n\n## Parameters\n\nDescribes

When reading, querying individual values using GL constants is the norm, and when writing, special purpose functions are provided for most parameters. luma.gl supports both forms for both reading and writing parameters.\n* Reading values from WebGL can be very slow if it requires a GPU roundtrip. To get around this, luma.gl reads values once, caches them and tracks them as they are changed through luma functions. The cached values can get out of sync if the context is shared outside of luma.gl.\n* luma.gl's state management enables \"conflict-free\" programming, so that even when setting global state, one part of the code does not need to worry about whether other parts are changing the global state.\n* Note that to fully support the conflict-free model and detect changes done e.g. in other WebGL libraries, luma.gl needs to hook into the WebGL context to track state changes.\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/gltools/parameter-setting","title":"Parameter Setting"},{"excerpt":"withParameters luma.gl enables a 'stateless' WebGL programming model.

It provides a number of features related to initialization and animation of a WebGL context.\n\n* Provides a number of commonly needed variables as part of the `context` object which is passed to `onRender` and `onFinalize` callbacks.\n* Objects returned by `onInitialize` will be appended to `context` object hence available to `onRender` and `onFinalize`.\n* To avoid problems with page load timing, move context creation to the `onCreateContext` method.\n* By default, `onRender` method manages resizing of canvas, viewport and framebuffer.\n* Makes it easy to wait for the HTML page to load before creating a canvas and WebGL resources.\n\nReferences:\n\n* [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-anti-patterns.html#drawingbuffer) contains excellent information on the subtleties of the how the WebGL context's drawing buffer and the HTML canvas interact.\n* When running in the browser, this class uses [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)\n\n\n## Usage\n\nAutocreates a canvas/context\n```js\nimport {AnimationLoop, ClipSpace} from '@luma.gl/core';\n\nconst animationLoop = new AnimationLoop({\n  onInitialize({gl}) {\n    // Keys in the object returned here will be available in onRender\n    return {\n      clipSpaceQuad: new ClipSpace({gl, fs: FRAGMENT_SHADER})\n    };\n  },\n  onRender({tick, clipSpaceQuad}) {\n    // Tick is autoupdated by AnimationLoop\n    clipSpaceQuad.setUniforms({uTime: tick * 0.01}).draw();\n  }\n});\n\nanimationLoop.start();\n```\n\nUse a canvas in the existing DOM through its HTML id\n```js\nanimationLoop.start({canvas: 'my-canvas'});\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### constructor(props : Object)\n\n```js\nnew AnimationLoop({\n  onCreateContext,\n  onInitialize,\n  onFinalize,\n  onRender,\n\n  autoResizeViewport,\n  autoResizeDrawingBuffer\n});\n```\n\n* `props.onCreateContext`=`null` (callback) - function without parameters that returns a `WebGLRenderingContext`. This callback will be called exactly once, after page load completes.\n* `props.onInitialize` (callback) - if supplied, will be called once after first `start()` has been called, after page load completes and a context has been created.\n* `props.onRender`=`null` (callback) - Called on every animation frame.\n* `props.onFinalize`=`null` (callback) - Called once when animation is stopped. Can be used to delete objects or free any resources created during `onInitialize`.\n* `props.autoResizeViewport`=`true` - If true, calls `gl.viewport(0, 0, gl.drawingBufferWidth, gl.drawingBufferHeight)` each frame before `onRender` is called. Set to false to control viewport size.\n* `props.autoResizeDrawingBuffer`=`true` - If true, checks the canvas size every frame and updates the drawing buffer size if needed.\n* `props.useDevicePixels` - Whether to use `window.devicePixelRatio` as a multiplier, e.g. in `autoResizeDrawingBuffer` etc. Refer to `Experimental API` section below for more use cases of this prop.\n* `props.gl`=`null` (WebGLContext) - If supplied, will render into this external context instead of creating a new one.\n* `props.glOptions`=`{}` (object) - Options to create the WebGLContext with. See [createGLContext](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/context.md).\n* `props.debug`=`false` (bool) - Enable debug mode will provide more validations and error messages, but less performant.\n* `props.createFramebuffer`=`false` (bool) - If true, will make a `framebuffer` (FrameBuffer) parameter available to `onInitialize` and `onRender` callbacks.\n\n\n### start([options : Object]) : AnimationLoop\n\nRestarts the animation\n\n`animationLoop.start(options)`\n\n* `options`=`{}` (object) - Options to create the WebGLContext with. See [createGLContext](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/context.md).\n\n### stop() : AnimationLoop\n\nStops the animation\n\n`animationLoop.stop()`\n\n### waitForRender() : Promise\n\nReturns a promise which resolves in the next frame after rendering and the `onRender` callback have completed.\n\n```js\nconst loop = await animationLoop.waitForRender()\n// can now read pixels from webgl context\nloop.gl.readPixels(...)\n```\n\n### redraw() : AnimationLoop\n\nImmediately invokes a redraw (call `onRender` with updated animation props). Only use if the canvas must be updated synchronously.\n\n### setNeedsRedraw(reason : String) : AnimationLoop\n\n`animationLoop.setNeedsRedraw(reason)`\n\n* `reason` (`String`) - A human readable string giving a hint as to why redraw was needed (e.g. \"geometry changed\").\n\nIf set, the value will be provided as the `needsRedraw` field to the `onRender` callback.\n\nNotes:\n* `onRender` will be called for each animation frame regardless of whether this flag is set, and the redraw reason is automatically cleared.\n* If called multiple times, the `reason` provided in the first call will be remembered.\n* `AnimationLoop` automatically sets this flag if the WebGL context's drawing buffer size changes.\n\n\n### setProps(props : Object) : AnimationLoop\n\n`animationLoop.setProps({...props})`\n\n* `props.autoResizeViewport` - Call `gl.viewport` before each call to `onRender()`\n* `props.autoResizeDrawingBuffer` - Update the drawing buffer size to match the canvas size before each call to `onRender()`\n* `props.useDevicePixels` - Whether to use `window.devicePixelRatio` as a multiplier, e.g. in `autoResizeDrawingBuffer` etc.\n\n### attachTimeline(timeline: Timeline)\n\nAttach an `Timeline` object to the animation loop. Allows time produced for animations to be paused, played, etc. See `Timeline` documentation for more info.\n\n\n### detachTimeline()\n\nDetach the currently attached timeline from the animation loop.\n\n\n### toDataURL\n\nReturns returns a `Promise` that resolves to the data URL of the canvas once drawing operations are complete for the current frame. The data URL can be used as the `src` for an HTML image element.\n\n`animationLoop.toDataURL()`\n\n\n## Callback Parameters\n\nThe callbacks `onInitialize`, `onRender` and `onFinalize` that the app supplies to the `AnimationLoop`, will be called with an object containing named parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| ---       | ---  | --- |\n| `_animationLoop` | `AnimationLoop` | (**experimental**) The calling `AnimationLoop` instance |\n| `gl`      | `WebGLRenderingContext` | This `AnimationLoop`'s gl context. |\n| `canvas`  | `HTMLCanvasElement` or `OffscreenCanvas` | The canvas associated with this context. |\n| `width`   | The drawing buffer width, in \"device\" pixels (can be different from canvas.width). |\n| `height`  | The drawing buffer height, in \"device\" pixels (can be different from canvas.width). |\n| `aspect`  | The canvas aspect ratio (width/height) to update projection matrices |\n| `useDevicePixels` | Boolean indicating if canvas is utilizes full resolution of Retina/\n| `needsRedraw` | `String` | Redraw flag (will be automatically set if drawingBuffer resizes) |\n| `time`    | `Number` | Milliseconds since `AnimationLoop` was created (monotonic). |\n| `tick`    | `Number` | Counter that updates for every frame rendered (monotonic). |\n| `framebuffer` | `FrameBuffer` | Availabel if `createFrameBuffer: true` was passed to the constructor. |\n| `_mousePosition` | `[x, y]` or `null` | (**experimental**) Current mouse position over the canvas. |\n| `_offScreen` | `Boolean` | (**experimental**) If the animation loop is rendering to an OffscreenCanvas. |\n| `_timeline` | `Trimeline` | (**experimental**) `Timeline` object tracking the animation timeline and channels. |\n| ...       | Any fields in the object that was returned by the `onInitialize` method. |\n\n### Frame timers\n* The animation loop tracks GPU and CPU render time of each frame the in member properties `cpuTime` and `gpuTime`. If `gpuTime` is set to `-1`, then the timing for the last frame was invalid and should not be used (this rare and might occur, for example, if the GPU was throttled mid-frame).\n\n\n## Experimental API (`useDevicePixels`)\n\n`useDevicePixels` can accept a custom ratio (Number), instead of `true` or `false`. This allows rendering to a much smaller or higher resolutions. When using high value (usually more than device pixel ratio), it is possible it can get clamped down, this happens due to system memory limitation, in such cases a warning will be logged to the browser console. For additional details check device pixels [`document`]((/docs/api-reference/webgl/device-pixels.md)).\n\n## Remarks\n\n* You can instantiate multiple `AnimationLoop` classes in parallel, rendering into the same or different `WebGLRenderingContext`s.\n* Works both in browser and under Node.js.\n* All `AnimationLoop` methods can be chained.\n* Postpones context creation until the page (i.e. all HTML) has been loaded. At this time it is safe to specify canvas ids when calling [`createGLContext`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/context.md).\n* The supplied callback function must return a WebGLRenderingContext or an error will be thrown.\n* This callback registration function should not be called if a `WebGLRenderingContext` was supplied to the AnimationLoop constructor.\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/engine/animation-loop","title":"AnimationLoop"},{"excerpt":"Model A  is a subclass of  that holds a reference to a mesh with a transformation matrix that describes its position and orientation.

Applications can use this…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Transform (WebGL2)\n\nThe `Transform` class provides easy interface to perform Transform Feedback operations on given data. Applications can use this class to move data processing from CPU to GPU, where multiple parallel execution units will be used for processing. Data is handled in form of `Buffer` objects, i.e. data resides in the GPU memory. Output of this class can directly set as attributes on `Model` or `VertexArray` for regular rendering operations, CPU access is not required hence avoids expensive CPU and GPU sync.\n\n`Transform` class creates and holds `Model` and `TransformFeedback` instances.\n\nThis class is only supported when using `WebGL2RenderingContext`.\n\n\n### Use case : Specify source and destination buffers.\n\nCreate a `Transform` object by passing, vs (vertex shader), source buffer(s), varyings (output variable names in vertex shader) and destination buffers. Then call `run` to perform one transform feedback iteration.\n\n```js\nconst VS = `\\\n#version 300 es\nattribute float inValue;\nvarying float outValue;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n  outValue = 2.0 * inValue;\n}\n`;\n\nconst sourceData = new Float32Array([10, 20, 31, 0, -57]);\nconst sourceBuffer = new Buffer(gl, {data: sourceData});\n\n// Default values applied for size (1) and type (gl.FLOAT)\nconst feedbackBuffer = new Buffer(gl, {byteLength: sourceData.length * 4});\n\nconst transform = new Transform(gl2, {\n  sourceBuffers: {\n    inValue: sourceBuffer\n  },\n  feedbackBuffers: {\n    outValue: feedbackBuffer\n  },\n  vs: VS,\n  varyings: ['outValue'],\n  elementCount: 5\n});\n\n// Perform one transform feedback iteration\ntransform.run();\n```\n\n### Use case : Create destination buffers automatically.\n\n`Transform` can internally create destination buffers (i.e. feedback buffers), when `feedbackMap` is provided. Each destination buffer is created with same settings and layout as corresponding source buffer as per `feedbackMap`.\n\n```js\nconst transform = new Transform(gl2, {\n  sourceBuffers: {\n    inValue: sourceBuffer\n  },\n  feedbackMap: {\n    inValue: 'outValue'\n  },\n  vs: VS,\n  varyings: ['outValue'],\n  elementCount: 5\n});\n\n```\n### Use case : Multiple iterations using swap().\n\nWhen `feedbackMap` is specified buffers can be swapped using a single call to `swap()`, this is useful for cases like particle simulation, where output of one transform feedback iteration is piped as input to the next iteration.\n\n```js\n\n// Setup Transform with `feedbackMap` as above\n\ntransform.run();\n\nlet bufferWithNewValues = transform.getBuffer('outValue');\n...\n// Render using 'bufferWithNewValues'\n...\n\n//swap buffers\ntransform.swap();\ntransform.run();\nbufferWithNewValues = transform.getBuffer('outValue');\n...\n// Render using 'bufferWithNewValues'\n...\n```\n\n### Use case : Update one or more buffers using update() method..\n\nOnce `Transform` object is constructed and used, one or more source or destination buffers can be updated using `update`.\n\n```js\n// transform is set up as above\n...\n\n// update buffer binding for 'inValue' attribute\nconst newSourceBuffer = new Buffer(gl, {data: newSourceData});\ntransform.update({\n  sourceBuffers: {\n    inValue: newSourceBuffer\n  }\n});\n\n// now data is provided from newly bound buffer.\ntransform.run();\n```\n\n### Use case : Reading source data from texture object (Experimental)\n\nIn addition to reading data from Buffer objects, Transform can read from texture objects. Transform allows to access texture data in the same way as buffer data and internally generates required texture co-ordinates and sample instructions.\n\n```js\n// simple shader that adds data from a buffer and texture to generate new buffer.\n\nconst vs = `\\\n#version 300 es\nin float inBuffer;\nin float inTexture;\nout float outBuffer;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n  outBuffer = inTexture + inBuffer;\n}`;\n\nconst sourceBuffer = new Buffer(...);\nconst sourceTexture = new Texture2D(...);\n\nconst transform = new Transform(gl2, {\n  sourceBuffers: {\n    inBuffer: sourceBuffer\n  },\n  // specify source texture object using input attribute name\n  _sourceTextures: {\n    inTexture: sourceTexture\n  },\n  vs,\n  feedbackMap: {\n    inBuffer: 'outBuffer'\n  },\n  elementCount\n});\n\ntransform.run();\n\n// resulting buffer contains sum of input buffer and texture data.\nconst outData = transform.getBuffer('outBuffer').getData();\n\n```\n\n### Use case : Generating a texture object (Experimental)\n\nIn addition to reading data from a texture object, Transform can generate texture object, by rendering data into it offline. Source data can be either buffer(s), texture(s) or any combination.\n\n```js\nconst vs = `\\\n#version 300 es\nin vec4 inTexture;\nout vec4 outTexture;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n  outTexture = 2. *  inTexture;\n}\n`\nconst sourceTexture = new Texture2D(...);\nconst transform = new Transform(gl2, {\n  _sourceTextures: {\n    inTexture: sourceTexture\n  },\n  _targetTexture: 'inTexture',\n  _targetTextureVarying: 'outTexture',\n  vs,\n  elementCount\n});\n\ntransform.run();\n\nconst outTexture = transform._getTargetTexture();\n\n```\n\n\n## Constructor\n\n### Transform(gl : WebGL2RenderingContext, props: Object)\n\nConstructs a `Transform` object.

If `Texture2D` object, it is used as is, if `String`, it must be one of the source texture attributes name, a new texture object is cloned from corresponding texture and used as color attachment.\n* `props._targetTextureVarying` (`String`) : varying name used in vertex shader who's data should go into target texture.\n* `props._swapTexture` (`String`) : source texture attribute name, that is swapped with target texture every time `swap()` is called.\n* `props._fs` (`String`, Optional) - fragment shader string, when rendering to a texture, fragments can be processed using this custom shader, when not specified, pass through fragment shader will be used.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Internally, creates `Model`, `TransformFeedback` and `Framebuffer` instances.\n\n\n### delete() : Transform\n\nDeletes all owned resources, `Model`, `TransformFeedback` and any `Buffer` objects that are crated internally.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### getBuffer(varyingName : String) : Buffer\n\nReturns current destination buffer corresponding to given varying name.\n\n* `varyingName` (`String`) - varying name.\n\n\n### getData([options : Object]) : ArrayBufferView\n\nReads and returns data from current destination buffer corresponding to the given varying name.

If not supplied, the previously set element count is used.\n\n\n### swap() : Transform\n\nSwaps source and destination buffers and textures. Buffer swapping is performed when `feedbackMap` is provided and texture swapping is performed when `_swapTexture` is provided. If buffer swapping is needed, `sourceBuffers` and `feedbackBuffers` supplied to the constructor and/or the `update` method must be `Buffer` objects.\n\n\n### \\_getTargetTexture() : Texture2D/null (EXPERIMENTAL)\n\nWhen transform is setup to render to a texture, returns current target texture, otherwise null.\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/engine/transform","title":"Transform (WebGL2)"},{"excerpt":"ProgramManager The  manages the creation and caching of programs.

It allows the application to request a program based on a vertex shader, fragment shader and set of defines, modules and code injections. The `ProgramManager` will return the requested program, creating it the first time, and re-using a cached version if it is requested more than once. It also allows for the definition of hook functions and module code injections to be inserted into shaders.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst pm = new ProgramManager(gl);\n\nconst vs = `\nattribute vec4 position;\n\nvoid main() {\n#ifdef MY_DEFINE\n  gl_Position = position;\n#else\n  gl_Position = position.wzyx;\n#endif\n}\n`;\n\nconst fs = `\nvoid main() {\n  gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n  MY_SHADER_HOOK(gl_FragColor);\n}\n`;\n\npm.addShaderHook('fs:MY_SHADER_HOOK(inout vec4 color)');\n\npm.addModuleInjection(picking, {\n  hook: 'fs:#MY_SHADER_HOOK',\n  injection: 'color = picking_filterColor(color);',\n  order: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY\n});\n\npm.addDefaultModule(dirlight); // Will be included in all following programs\n\nconst program1 = pm.get({vs, fs});   // Basic, no defines, only default module\nconst program2 = pm.get({vs, fs});   // Cached, same as program 1, use count 2\nconst program3 = pm.get({  // New program, with different source based on define\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  defines: {\n    MY_DEFINE: true\n  }\n});\n\nconst program4 = pm.get({  // New program, with different source based on module and its injection\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  defines: {\n    MY_DEFINE: true\n  },\n  modules: [picking]\n});\n\nconst program5 = pm.get({  // Cached, same as program 4, use count 2\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  defines: {\n    MY_DEFINE: true\n  },\n  modules: [picking]\n});\n\npm.release(program1); // Cached program still available, use count 1\npm.release(program2); // Cached program deleted\npm.release(program3); // Cached program deleted\npm.release(program4); // Cached program still available, use count 1\npm.release(program5); // Cached program deleted\n```\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### get(opts : Object) : Program\n\nGet a program that fits the parameters provided. If one is already cached, return it, otherwise create and cache a new one.\n`opts` can include the following (see `assembleShaders` for details):\n* `vs`: Base vertex shader source.\n* `fs`: Base fragment shader source.\n* `defines`: Object indicating `#define` constants to include in the shaders.\n* `modules`: Array of module objects to include in the shaders.\n* `inject`: Object of hook injections to include in the shaders.\n\n### `addDefaultModule(module: Object)`\n\nAdd a module that will automatically be added to any programs created by the program manager.\n\n### `removeDefaultModule(module: Object)`\n\nRemove a module that is automatically being added to programs created by the program manager.\n\n### `addShaderHook(hook : String, [opts : Object])`\n\nCreates a shader hook function that shader modules can injection code into. Shaders can call these functions, which will be no-ops by default. If a shader module injects code it will be executed upon the hook function call. This mechanism allows the application to create shaders that can be automatically extended by included shader modules.\n\n- `hook`: `vs:` or `fs:` followed by the name and arguments of the function, e.g. `vs:MYHOOK_func(inout vec4 value)`. Hook name without arguments\nwill also be used as the name of the shader hook\n- `opts.header` (optional): code always included at the beginning of a hook function\n- `opts.footer` (optional): code always included at the end of a hook function\n\n### `addModuleInjection(module : Object, opts : Object)`\n\nDefine a code injection for a particular hook function (defined by `addShaderHook`) and shader module. The injection code will be inserted into the hook function whenever the shader module is included.\n\n- `module`: module object for which the injection is being defined\n- `opts.hook`: the shader hook to inject into. This can be a hook function defined by `addShaderHook` or a predefined injection key (see below),\nprefixed by `vs:` for the vertex shader or `fs:` for the fragment shader.\n- `opts.injection`: the injection code\n- `opts.order` (optional): the priority with which to inject code into the shader hook. Lower priority numbers will\nbe injected first\n\n### getUniforms(program : Program) : Object\n\nReturns an object containing all the uniforms defined for the program. Returns `null` if `program` isn't managed by the `ProgramManager`.\n\n### release(program : Program)\n\nIndicate that a program is no longer in use. When all references to a program are released, the program is deleted.\n\n\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/engine/program-manager","title":"ProgramManager"},{"excerpt":"Buffer A  is a WebGL object that stores an chunk of memory allocated by the GPU.

This memory can be accessed directly by the GPU and is used to store things like vertex data, pixel data retrieved from images or the framebuffer, etc. The `Buffer` class provides mechanism for allocating such memory, together with facilities for copying data to and from the GPU (usually via JavaScript typed arrays).\n\nFor additional information, see [OpenGL Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Buffer_Object).\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport {Buffer} from '@luma.gl/core';\n```\n\nCreating a generic buffer\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl);\n```\n\nCreating an elements buffer\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, {target: GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER});\n```\n\nAllocating memory in a buffer\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, {byteLength: 200});\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl).initialize({byteLength: 200});\n```\n\nAllocating and initializing a buffer\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, {\n  target: GL.ELEMENTS_ARRAY_BUFFER,\n  data: new Uint32Array([1, 2, 3])\n});\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([1, 2, 3])); // Allocate+init 12 bytes of GPU memory\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, 200); // Allocate 200 bytes of GPU memory\n```\n\nUpdating a buffer\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, {byteLength: 200})\nbuffer.subData(new Float32Array(...));\n```\n\nCopying data between buffers (WebGL2)\n```js\nconst sourceBuffer = ...\nconst destinationBuffer = ...\n\n// To copy 32 bytes from sourceBuffer to destinationBuffer\ndestinationBuffer.copyData({sourceBuffer, size: 32});\n\n// To copy 32 bytes from sourceBuffer at 8 byte offset into\n// destinationBuffer at 16 byte offset.\ndestinationBuffer.copyData({\n  sourceBuffer,\n  readOffset: 8,\n  writeOffset: 16,\n  size: 32\n});\n```\n\nGetting data from a buffer (WebGL2)\n```js\nconst buffer = ...;\n\n// To get all the data from buffer\nconst data = buffer.getData();\n\n// To get all the data from buffer starting from byteOffset 8\n// into existing ArrayBufferView.\nconst existingArray = ...\nconst data = buffer.getData({dstData: existingArray, srcByteOffset: 8});\n// Maximum possible elements will be copied based buffer and dstData size.\n\n// To get 5 elements from source buffer starting from byteOffset 8\n// into existing ArrayBufferView starting from 3rd element position.\nconst existingArray = ...\nconst data = buffer.getData({dstData: existingArray, srcByteOffset: 8, dstOffset: 3, length: 5});\n\n```\n\n\n## Members\n\n##### `handle` : `WebGLBuffer`\n\nHolds the underlying WebGL object reference.\n\n\n##### `byteLength` : Number\n\nNumber of bytes of allocated memory.\n\n\n#### `bytesUsed` : Number\n\nSame as `byteLength` unless the `Buffer.reallocate` has been called with a value smaller than the actual length of the buffer.\n\n\n##### `accessor` : `Accessor`\n\nHolds an `Accessor` instance. By default it contains type information that is automatically deducted from the type of data used to initialize the buffer, but the application can store any `Accessor` it wants with the `Buffer`. This can simplify handling of buffer related data in many basic use cases (e.g. when buffers are not shared by multiple attributes etc).\n\n\n## Constructor\n\n### Buffer(gl : WebGLRenderingContext, props : Object | TypedArray | Number)\n\nCreates a new `Buffer`. Multiple signatures are supported:\n\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, {target, ...initOptions, accessor, ...accessorOptions});\n```\n\n* `gl` (`WebGLRenderingContext`) - gl context\n* `target`= (*GLenum*, optional) - the type of buffer, see below.\n* `...initOptions` (*Object*) - options passed on to `initialize`.\n* `accessor` - options used to create the `accessor`\n* `...accessorOptions` (DEPRECATED) - options passed on to `setAccessor`. Use `accessor` instead.\n\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, typedArray);\n```\n\n* `gl` (`WebGLRenderingContext`) - gl context\n* `typedArray` - typed array with values that should be used to size and initialize the new GPU buffer. Short hand for `new Buffer({data: typedArray})`.\n\n```js\nconst buffer = new Buffer(gl, byteLength);\n```\n\n* `gl` (`WebGLRenderingContext`) - gl context\n* `byteLength` - specifies the number of bytes that should be allocated (but not initialized). Short hand for `new Buffer({byteLength})`.\n\nThe newly constructed buffer will either be a an \"element\" buffer used for storing vertex indices, or a \"generic\" buffer that can be used to store other things. To create an element buffer, specify `target: GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER`. If target is not specified, it will be a generic buffer that can be used in a variety of situations.\n\n* In WebGL1, the default target is `GL.ARRAY_BUFFER` which will work as a \"generic\" (i.e. non-element) buffer.\n* In WebGL2, the default target is `GL.COPY_READ_BUFFER` which means the buffer can work either as a generic buffer and an element buffer. This will be determined when it is first used with (bound to) a specific target. From that point on, WebGL will consider it either as an element buffer or a generic buffer.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### initialize(props : Object) : Buffer\n\nAllocates and optionally initializes buffer memory/data store (releasing any previously allocated memory).\n\nAlso extracts characteristics of stored data, hints for vertex attribute.\n\n```js\nBuffer.initialize({data, byteLength, usage=, dataType=, size=, accessor=, ...accessorOptions})\nBuffer(gl, typedArray);\nBuffer(gl, byteLength);\n``````\n\n* `data` (ArrayBufferView) - contents\n* `byteLength` (Number) - the size of the buffer object's data store.\n* `usage`=`GL.STATIC_DRAW` (GLenum) - Allocation hint for GPU driver.\n* `accessor` (Object) - object with accessor props to be stored as accessor.\n* `...accessorOptions` (DEPRECATED) -  parameters passed to `setAccessor`\n\n\n### reallocate(byteLength : Number) : Buffer\n\nIf necessary, increases buffer size to `byteLength`. Does not decrease the buffer's size if already long enough.\n\n* `byteLength` (Number) - the minimum size of the buffer object's data store.\n\nReturns:\n\n* `true` - if reallocation happened (in which case any stored data was invalidated).\n* `false` - if the `Buffer` was already big enough in which case any uploaded data remains intact.\n\n\n### subData({data , offset=, srcOffset=, length=}) : Buffer\n\nUpdates part or all of a buffer's allocated memory.\n\n`Buffer.subData({data, offset=, srcOffset=, length=})`\n\n* `data` (`ArrayBufferView`) - length is inferred unless provided\n* `offset`=`0` - Offset into buffer\n* `srcOffset`=`0` -  WebGL2: Offset into srcData\n* `length` - WebGL2: Number of bytes to be copied\n\n\n### copyData(options : Object) : Buffer (WebGL2)\n\nCopies part of the data of another buffer into this buffer. The copy happens on the GPU and is expected to be efficient.\n\n`Buffer.copyData({sourceBuffer, readOffset=, writeOffset=, size})`\n\n* `options.sourceBuffer` (`Buffer`) - the buffer to read data from.\n* `options.readOffset`=`0` (GLint) - byte offset from which to start reading from the buffer.\n* `options.writeOffset`=`0` (GLint) - byte offset from which to start writing to the buffer.\n* `options.size` (GLsizei) - byte count, specifying the size of the data to be copied.\n\nNote:\n\n* `readOffset`, `writeOffset` and `size` must all be greater than or equal to zero.\n* `readOffset + sizereadOffset + size` must not exceeed the size of the source buffer object\n* `writeOffset + sizewriteOffset + size` must not exceeed the size of the buffer bound to writeTarget.\n* If the source and destination are the same buffer object, then the source and destination ranges must not overlap.\n\n\n### getData() : TypedArray (WebGL2)\n\nReads data from buffer into an `ArrayBufferView` or `SharedArrayBuffer`.\n\n`Buffer.getData({dstData, srcByteOffset, srcOffset, length})`\n\n* `dstData`=`null` (`ArrayBufferView` | `SharedArrayBuffer` | `null`)  - memory to which to write the buffer data. New ArrayBufferView allocated with correct type if not provided.\n* `srcByteOffset`=`0` (GLintptr) - byte offset from which to start reading from the buffer.\n* `srcOffset`=`0` (GLuint) - element index offset where to start reading the buffer.\n* `length`=`0` (GLuint)  Optional, Element count to be copied, optimal value calculated when not provided.\n\nReturns a typed array containing the data from the buffer (if `dstData` was supplied it will be returned, otherwise this will be a freshly allocated array).\n\n\n### getElementCount([accessor : Accessor]) : Number\n\nReturns number of elements in the buffer. In a buffer created with Float32Array typed array, each float is an element and takes 4 bytes (or 32 bits).\n\n\n### setAccessor(accessor : Accessor | Object) : Buffer\n\nAllows you to optionally describe the accessor properties of the data in the buffer. This does not affect the buffer itself, but if supplied can avoid having to supply this data again when you use this buffer as an attribute later (see `VertexArray.setAttributes`).\n\nFor details on accessor props, see the documentation for the [`Accessor`]() class.\n\n\n## Types\n\n### Usage\n\n| Usage             | WebGL2 | WebGL1 | Description |\n| ---               | ---    | ---    | ---         |\n| `GL.STATIC_DRAW`  | Yes    | Yes    | Buffer will be used often and not change often.

Buffer binding and unbinding is handled internal by luma.gl methods and applications typically do not need to bind buffers.\n\nTo support use cases integrating with external libraries or raw webgl code, it is of course possible to \"manually\" bind and unbind luma.gl `Buffer` instances:\n\n```js\nconst buffer = ...;\nbuffer.bind({target: GL.ARRAY_BUFFER});\n...\nbuffer.unbind({target: GL.ARRAY_BUFFER});\n```\nWebGL2 examples\n```js\nbuffer.bind({target: GL.PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER});\nbuffer.bind({target: GL.PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER});\nbuffer.bind({target: GL.TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, index: 0});\nbuffer.bind({target: GL.UNIFORM_BUFFER, index: 0, offset: ..., size: ...});\nbuffer.unbind({target: GL.UNIFORM_BUFFER, index: 0});\n```\n\n\n## Remarks\n\n* All instance methods in a buffer (unless they return some documented value) are chainable.\n* While transferring memory between CPU and GPU takes some time, once the memory is available as a buffer on the GPU it can be very efficiently used as inputs and outputs by the GPU.\n\nNote that in WebGL, there are two types of buffers:\n* \"element\" buffers. These can only store vertex attributes with indices (a.k.a \"elements\") and can only be used by binding them to the `GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER` before draw calls.\n* \"generic\" buffers. These can be used interchangeably to store different types of data, including (non-index) vertex attributes.\n\nFor more on the `GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER` restrictions in WebGL, see [this page](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/#webgl_gl_differences) for WebGL1 and [this page](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/2.0/#webgl_gl_differences) for WebGL2.\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/webgl/buffer","title":"Buffer"},{"excerpt":"SnapshotTestRunner Client-side utility for browser-based WebGL render tests.

Signed values are normalized to [-1,1] and unsigned values are normalized to [0,1].\n\n### `integer` **WebGL2**\n\nDisable conversion of integer values to floats.\n\n\n## Static Methods\n\n### Accessor.merge(accessor1, accessor2, ...) : Accessor\n\nMerges a number of partial accessors into a merged accessor that can be used to set vertex attributes. Any unspecified accessor properties will be set to their default values.\n\nNote: Most applications do not need to merge accessors directly. Merging is done by the `VertexArray.setAttributes` method.\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### constructor(props : Object)\n\nCreates a new partial `Accessor`. The new object will be immutable, i.e. its values cannot be changed after creation.\n\n\n### `BYTES_PER_ELEMENT` : Number\n\nReturns the number of bytes per \"element\", based on the `type` field in the accessor. Asserts if type is not set.\n\n### `BYTES_PER_VERTEX` : Number\n\nReturns the number of bytes per \"vertex\", based on the `type` and `size` fields in the accessor. Asserts if `type` and `size` are not set.\n\n\n\n## Remarks: Auto-deduction\n\n* `type` and `size` are automatically inferred (through WebGL APIs that provide access to metadata extracted during compilation and linking of shader programs).\n* `divisor` - if attribute name starts with `instance...` this will be automatically set to `1`.\n* `offset` and `stride` are assumed to be 0 which corresponds to the simple non-interleaved case.\n* `integer` - if type is `GL.INT` or `GL.UINT`, then integer is automatically true, as floating point shader inputs cannot be mapped to such attributes.\n\n\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/webgl/accessor","title":"Accessor"},{"excerpt":"Moving Data  offers a set of functions that copy or blit data from and to Texture and Framebuffer objects.

For this reason, luma.gl [`Program.draw`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/program.md) call takes an optional `TransformFeedback` object as a parameter and activates and deactivates it before and after the draw call.\n\nFinally, note that when using transform feedback it is frequently desirable to turn off rasterization: `gl.enable(GL.RASTERIZER_DISCARD)` to prevent the fragment shader from running.\n\nFor more information, see [OpenGL Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Transform_Feedback).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSetting up a model object for transform feedback.\n\n```js\nconst model = new Model(gl, {\n  vs,\n  fs,\n  varyings: ['gl_Position', 'outputColor'],\n  ...\n});\n```\n\nSetting up a transform feedback object and binding buffers\n\n```js\nconst transformFeedback = new TransformFeedback(gl)\n  .setBuffer(0, bufferPosition)\n  .setBuffer(1, bufferColor);\n```\n\nWhen binding the buffers, index should be equal to the corresponding varying entry in `varyings` array passed to `Program` constructor.\n\nBuffers can also be bound using varying name if information about varyings are retrieved from `Program` object.\n\n```js\nconst transformFeedback = new TransformFeedback(gl, {\n  program: ..., // linked program, configuration will be read from it\n  buffers: {\n    outputColor: bufferColor,\n    gl_Position: bufferPosition\n  }\n});\n```\n\nRunning program (drawing) with implicit activation of transform feedback (will call `begin` and `end` on supplied `transformFeedback`)\n\n```js\nmodel.draw({\n  drawMode,\n  vertexCount,\n  ...,\n  transformFeedback\n});\n```\n\nRunning a transform feedback operation while turning off rasterization (drawing):\n\n```js\nmodel.transform({\n  drawMode,\n  ...,\n  transformFeedback\n});\n```\n\nor equivalently, just call draw with an additional parameter:\n\n```js\nconst parameters = {[GL.RASTERIZER_DISCARD]: true}\nmodel.draw({..., transformFeedback, parameters});\n```\n\n\n## Methods\n\n### constructor(gl : WebGL2RenderingContext, props: Object)\n\nSee `TransformFeedback.setProps` for parameters.\n\nWebGL APIs [`gl.createTransformFeedback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext/createTransformFeedback)\n\n\n### initialize(props : Object) : TransformFeedback\n\nReinitializes an existing `TransformFeedback` object with new props.\n\n\n### setProps(props : Object) : TransformFeedback\n\n* `props.program`= (Object) - Gets a mapping of varying name to buffer indices from a linked program if supplied.\n* `props.buffers`=(Object) - Map of location index or name to Buffer object or buffer parameters object.

Bytes will be \"uninitialized\". |\n| `typed array`                      | Bytes will be interpreted according to format/type parameters and pixel store parameters. |\n| `Buffer` or `WebGLBuffer` (`WebGL2`) | Bytes will be interpreted according to format/type parameters and pixel store parameters. |\n| `Image` (`HTMLImageElement`)       | image will be used to fill the texture. width and height will be deduced. |\n| `Video` (`HTMLVideoElement`)       | video will be played, continously updating the texture. width and height will be deduced. |\n| `Canvas` (`HTMLCanvasElement`)     | canvas will be used to fill the texture. width and height will be deduced. |\n| `ImageData`                        | `canvas.getImageData()` - Used to fill the texture. width and height will be deduced. |\n\n\n\n## Texture Formats\n\n### Internal Format\n\nIf an application wants to store the texture at a certain resolution or in a certain format, it can request the resolution and format with `internalFormat`. WebGL will choose an internal representation with least the internal component sizes, and exactly the component types shown for that format, although it may not match exactly.\n\nWebGL2 adds sized internal formats which enables the application to request\nspecific components sizes and types (float and integer formats).

While it is crucial for the operation of a program, its presence under WebGL1 is dependent on an [extension](https://webglstats.com/webgl/extension/OES_vertex_array_object) that is fairly common, but not universally available. In particular it is not available in headless gl which is essential for running tests under Node.js.\n\nTherefore, in basic WebGL environments where the `VertexArrayObject` is not supported, luma.gl ensures that one (\"fake\") instance of the `VertexArrayObject` class can still be obtained, emulating the default (`null` handle) `VertexArrayObject`. This instance has the `isDefaultArray` flag set, and applications can adapt their behavior accordingly, while still using the same API to manage vertex attributes, albeit with a small performance loss. Since there is a considerable amount of work required to handle both cases, luma.gl also provides a higher level `VertexArray` class that works around these issues and provided additional conveniences.\n\n> It is usually not necessary to create neither `VertexArrayObject` nor `VertexArray` instances in luma.gl applications. It is often simpler to just provides attributes directly to the [`Model`](/docs/api-reference/core/model.md) class. Still, it can be useful to review this documentation to understand how attributes are handled by WebGL.\n\nFor more information on WebGL `VertexArrayObject`s, see the [OpenGL Wiki](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Array_Object).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nImport the `VertexArrayObject` class so that your app can use it:\n\n```js\nimport {VertexArrayObject} from '@luma.gl/core';\n```\n\nGetting the global `VertexArrayObject` for a WebGL context\n\n```js\nconst vertexArray = VertexArray.getDefaultArray(gl);\n```\n\nCreate a new VertexArray\n\n```js\nconst vao = new VertexArray(gl);\n}\n```\n\nAdding attributes to a VertexArray\n\n```js\nconst vertexArray = new VertexArray(gl);\nvertexArray.setBuffer(location, buffer);\n```\n\nDeleting a VertexArray\n\n```js\nvertexArrayObject.delete();\n```\n\nSetting a constant vertex attribute\n\n```js\nimport {VertexArray} from '@luma.gl/core';\nconst vao = new VertexArray(gl);\nvao.setConstant(0, [0, 0, 0]);\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n`VertexArrayObject` inherits from `Resource`.\n\n\n### VertexArray(gl : WebGLRenderingContext, props : Object)\n\nCreates a new VertexArray\n\n* `props` (Object) - passed through to `Resource` superclass constructor and to `initialize`\n\n\n### VertexArray.getDefaultArray() : VertexArray\n\nReturns the \"global\" `VertexArrayObject`.\n\nNote: The global `VertexArrayObject` object is always available. Binds the `null` VertexArrayObject.\n\n\n### initialize(props : Object) : VertexArray\n\nReinitializes a `VertexArrayObject`.\n\n* `attributes`=`{}` (`Object`) - map of attributes, can be keyed by index or names, can be constants (small arrays), `Buffer`, arrays or typed arrays of numbers, or attribute descriptors.\n* `elements`=`null` (`Buffer`) - optional buffer representing elements array (i.e. indices)\n* `program` - Transfers information on vertex attribute locations and types to this vertex array.\n\n\n### setConstant(values : Array) : VertexArray\n\nSets a constant value for a vertex attribute. When this `VertexArrayObject` is used in a `Program.draw()` call, all Vertex Shader invocations will get the same value.\n\n`VertexArray.setConstant(location, array);`\n\n* `gl` (`WebGLRenderingContext`) - gl context\n* `location` (*GLuint*) - index of the attribute\n\nWebGL APIs:\n[vertexAttrib4[u]{f,i}v](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/vertexAttrib)\n\n\n### setBuffer(nameOrLocation, buffer : Buffer [, accessor : Object]) : VertexArray\n\nBinds the specified attribute in this vertex array to the supplied buffer\n\n* Set a location in vertex attributes array to a buffer, specifying\n* its data layout and integer to float conversion and normalization flags\n\n`setBuffer(location, buffer);`\n`setBuffer(location, buffer, {offset = 0, stride = 0, normalized = false, integer = false});`\n\n* `location` (*GLuint* | *String*) - index/ordinal number of the attribute\n* `buffer` (*WebGLBuffer*|*Buffer*) - WebGL buffer to set as value\n\n[gl.vertexAttrib{I}Pointer](), [gl.vertexAttribDivisor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext/vertexAttribDivisor)\n\n\n### getParameter(pname, location) : *\n\nQueries a vertex attribute location.\n\n* `pname` (GLenum) - Which parameter to query. See table of parameter constants below for values.\n* **location** (*Number*) - index of attributes\n\nNote that in WebGL queries are generally slow and should be avoided in performance critical code sections.\n\n\n## Types, Constants, Enumarations\n\n\n### getParameter Constants\n\n| Parameter                           | Type         | Value |\n| ---                                 | ---          | ---   |\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING` | `WebGLBuffer` (not `Buffer`) | Get currently bound buffer |\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_ENABLED`    | `GLboolean`  | true if the vertex attribute at this index is enabled |\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_SIZE`       | `GLint`      | indicating the size of an element of the vertex array. |\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_STRIDE`     | `GLint`      | indicating the number of bytes between successive elements in  |the array. 0 means that the elements are sequential.\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_TYPE`       | `GLenum`     | The array type. One of\n`GL.BYTE`, `GL.UNSIGNED_BYTE`, `GL.SHORT`, `GL.UNSIGNED_SHORT`, `GL.FIXED`, `GL.FLOAT`. |\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_NORMALIZED` | `GLboolean`  | true if fixed-point data types are normalized for the vertex attribute array at the given index. |\n| `GL.CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB`          | `Float32Array(4)` | The current value of the vertex attribute at the given index. |\nWhen using a WebGL 2 context, the following values are available additionally:\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_INTEGER`    | `GLboolean`  | true if an integer data type is in the vertex attribute array at the given index. |\n| `GL.VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_DIVISOR`    | `GLint`      | The frequency divisor used for instanced rendering. |\n\n\n## Attribute Accessors\n\nWhen setting `Buffer` attributes, additional data can be provided to specify how the buffer should be accessed. This data can be stored directly on the `Buffer` accessor or supplied to `.setBuffer`.\n\n* `target`=`buffer.target` (*GLuint*, ) - which target to bind to\n* `size` (*GLuint*)  - number of values (components) per element (1-4)\n* `type` (*GLuint*)  - type of values (e.g. gl.FLOAT)\n* `normalized` (*boolean*, false) - normalize integers to [-1,1] or [0,1]\n* `integer` (*boolean*, false) - `WebGL2` disable int-to-float conversion\n* `stride` (*GLuint*, 0) - supports strided arrays\n* `offset` (*GLuint*, 0) - supports strided arrays\n* `layout.normalized`=`false` (GLbool) - normalize integers to [-1,1], [0,1]\n* `layout.integer`=`false` (GLuint) - WebGL2 only, disable int-to-float conv.\n\n* `divisor` - Sets the frequency divisor used for instanced rendering (instances that pass between updates of attribute). Usually simply set to 1 or 0 to enable/disable instanced rendering. 0 disables instancing, >=1 enables it.\n\nNotes:\n\n* The application can enable normalization by setting the `normalized` flag to `true` in the `setBuffer` call.\n* **WebGL2** The application can disable integer to float conversion when running under WebGL2, by setting the `integer` flag to `true`.\n* [`glVertexAttribIPointer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext/vertexAttribIPointer) specifies *integer* data formats and locations of vertex attributes. Values are always left as integer values. Only accepts the integer types gl.BYTE, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, gl.SHORT, gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT, gl.INT, gl.UNSIGNED_INT\n\nNotes about Instanced Rendering\n\n* About setting `divisor` in attributes: Instanced attributes requires WebGL2 or a (widely supported) WebGL1 extension. Apps can use the luma.gl feature detection system to determine if instanced rendering is available, though the extension is so ubiquitously supported that many apps just make the assumption: [instanced_arrays](https://webglstats.com/webgl/extension/ANGLE_instanced_arrays).\n* An attribute is referred to as **instanced** if its divisor value is non-zero.\n* The divisor modifies the rate at which vertex attributes advance when rendering multiple instances of primitives in a single draw call.\n* If divisor is zero, the attribute at slot index advances once per vertex.\n* If divisor is non-zero, the attribute advances once per divisor instances of the set(s) of vertices being rendered.\n\n\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/webgl/vertex-array-object","title":"VertexArrayObject"},{"excerpt":"picking (Shader Module) Provides support for color-coding-based picking.

For example if we define a shader hook as `fs:MY_HOOK_FUNCTION(inout vec4 color)`, `assembleShader` will inject the following function automatically into our fragment shader:\n```c\nvoid MY_HOOK_FUNCTION(inout vec4 color) {\n\n}\n```\nWe can the write our fragment shader as follows:\n\n```c\nprecision highp float;\n\nvoid main() {\n  vec4 color = vec4(1.0);\n  gl_FragColor = MY_HOOK_FUNCTION(color)\n}\n```\nBy default, the hook function is a no-op, so this doesn't do anything. However, if we add a module injection like the following:\n\n```js\n{\n  picking: {\n    'fs:VERTEX_HOOK_FUNCTION': 'color = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd pass the `picking` module to `assembledShaders`, the hook function will be updated as follows:\n\n```c\nvoid MY_HOOK_FUNCTION(inout vec4 color) {\n  color = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n```\n\nThe hook function now changes the color from white to red.\n\n\n## Constants and Values\n\n### Predefined Injection Hooks\n\n| Key              | Shader   | Description      |\n| ---              | ---      | ---              |\n| `vs:#decl`       | Vertex   | Inject at top of shader (declarations) |\n| `vs:#main-start` | Vertex   | Injected at the very beginning of main function |\n| `vs:#main-end`   | Vertex   | Injected at the very end of main function |\n| `fs:#decl`       | Fragment | Inject at top of shader (declarations) |\n| `fs:#main-start` | Fragment | Injected at the very beginning of main function |\n| `fs:#main-end`   | Fragment | Injected at the very end of main function |\n\n## Usage\n\n\n### Injection Map\n\n`assembleShaders` (and `Model` constructor) will take a new `inject` argument that contains a map of:\n\n* keys indicating hooks (predefined or functions)\n* values representing code to be injected. This can be either a simple string or an object containing the `injection` string and an `order` indicating its priority.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\n  inject: {\n    'fs:#main-end': '  gl_FragColor = picking_filterColor(gl_FragColor)'\n  }\n```\n\n```js\nProgramManager.getDefaultProgramManager(gl).addShaderHook('fs:MYHOOK_fragmentColor(inout vec4 color)');\n\nnew Model(gl, {\n  vs,\n  fs: `void main() {\n    MYHOOK_fragmentColor(gl_FragColor);\n  }`,\n  modules: [picking]\n  inject: {\n    'fs:#main-start': 'gl_FragColor = vec4(1., 0., 0., 1.);';\n    'fs:MYHOOK_fragmentColor': {\n      injection: '  color = picking_filterColor(color);',\n      order: 9999\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\n### Remarks\n\n* Injection at the moment only allows code to be added, not replaced.\n* At the moment the implementation for injection are fairly simple. They depend on the shader code being well organized. For instance they require that the main function must come last in the app shader. In case of issues, try to make sure that line breaks, spacing etc are natural.\n\n\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/shadertools/assemble-shaders","title":"Shadertools API Reference"},{"excerpt":"KeyFrames Manages key frame animation data.

Usually simply set to 1 or 0 to enable/disable instanced rendering. 0 disables instancing, >=1 enables it.\n\n\n## Notes about Integer Attributes\n\n* The application can enable normalization by setting the `normalized` flag to `true` in the `setBuffer` call.\n* **WebGL2** The application can disable integer to float conversion when running under WebGL2, by setting the `integer` flag to `true`.\n* [`glVertexAttribIPointer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext/vertexAttribIPointer) specifies *integer* data formats and locations of vertex attributes. Values are always left as integer values. Only accepts the integer types gl.BYTE, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, gl.SHORT, gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT, gl.INT, gl.UNSIGNED_INT\n\n\n## Notes about Instanced Rendering\n\n* About setting `divisor` in attributes: Instanced attributes requires WebGL2 or a (widely supported) WebGL1 extension. Apps can use the luma.gl feature detection system to determine if instanced rendering is available, though the extension is so ubiquitously supported that many apps just make the assumption: [instanced_arrays](https://webglstats.com/webgl/extension/ANGLE_instanced_arrays).\n* An attribute is referred to as **instanced** if its divisor value is non-zero.\n* The divisor modifies the rate at which vertex attributes advance when rendering multiple instances of primitives in a single draw call.\n* If divisor is zero, the attribute at slot index advances once per vertex.\n* If divisor is non-zero, the attribute advances once per divisor instances of the set(s) of vertices being rendered.\n\n## Notes about setting *mat* type attributes\n\n* Setting a **mat** type in the shader requires to manually add an *offset* to the location.\n* This can be done by using special name format `name__LOCATION_0`. This will add 0 to the *LOCATION* resulting in no change. `name__LOCATION_1` will add **1**.\n* For example:\n  * if we have the following declaration in the shader:\n```\nattribute mat4 matrix;\n```\n  * We should specify `matrix__LOCATION_0`, `matrix__LOCATION_1`, `matrix__LOCATION_2` **and** `matrix__LOCATION_3` as *vec4*.\n","slug":"docs/api-reference/webgl/vertex-array","title":"VertexArray"},{"excerpt":"Timeline Manages an animation timeline, with multiple channels that can be running at different rates, durations, etc. Many methods…","rawMarkdownBody":"# Timeline\n\nManages an animation timeline, with multiple channels that can be running at different rates, durations, etc. Many methods (`play`, `pause`) assume that the `update` method is being called once per frame with a \"global time\".

Unfortunately, the raw WebGL API sometimes expose the same functionalities through APIs that are slightly different and not exactly compatible.\n\nTo simplify detecting and working with conditionally available capabilities (or \"features\") luma.gl provides:\n\n* A set of functions (e.g. [`isWebGL2`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/is-webGL2.md), [`getFeatures`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/get-features.md) and [`hasFeatures`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/context/has-features.md), described in this document) that enable you to check if the application is currently running on an environment that supports a certain feature (regardless of whether it is supported through e.g. WebGL2 or a WebGL1 extension).\n\nIn addition, luma.gl's WebGL classes transparently use WebGL extensions or WebGL2 APIs as appropriate, meaning that the amount of conditional logic in application code can be kept to a minimum. Once you have established that a capability exists, luma.gl offers you one unified way to use it.\n\n\n## Usage\n\nCheck if a feature is available (whether as a WebGL1 or WebGL2 extension or through WebGL2)\n```js\nimport {hasFeature, FEATURES} from '@luma.gl/core';\nif (hasFeature(gl, FEATURES.INSTANCED_RENDERING)) {\n   // Will work both on WebGL1 (via extension) and WebGL2 via the standard API\n   program.draw({instanceCount: ..., ....});\n}\n```\n\nAnother example of feature detection\n```js\nimport {hasFeature, FEATURES} from '@luma.gl/core';\n// Checks if `Query` objects can do async queries of GPU timings\nif (hasFeature(gl, FEATURES.TIMER_QUERY)) {\n   ...\n}\n// Alternatively - do the same query using raw extensions\nif (hasFeature(gl, 'EXT_disjoint_timer_query') || hasFeature(gl, 'EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2')) {\n   ...\n}\n```\n\n\nThere are a few additional capability query functions sprinkled through the luma.gl API. In particular, WebGL2 specific classes have an `isSupported` method that duplicates some of the queryies that can be made using the capability system\n```js\nimport {Query} from '@luma.gl/core';\nif (Query.isSupported(gl)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Functions\n\n### hasFeature\n\nAllows the app to query whether a capability is supported without being concerned about how it is being provided (WebGL2, an extension etc)\n\n* `gl` (`WebGLRenderingContext`) - gl context\n* capability (`String`) - capability name (can be a webgl extension name or a luma.gl `FEATURES` constant).\n\n### hasFeatures\n\nAllows the app to query whether a capability is supported without being concerned about how it is being provided (WebGL2, an extension etc)\n\n* `gl` (`WebGLRenderingContext`) - gl context\n* feature (`String`|`String[]`) - capability name (can be a webgl extension name or a luma.gl `FEATURES` constant).\n\n### getFeatures\n\nThis function returns an object containing all available features.\n\n## WebGL Feature Detection\n\n### WebGL2 Classes with some WebGL1 support\n\nNote that luma has a few WebGL2 classes that **can** be instantiated under WebGL1\n* `VertexAttributeObject`. Can be instanitated under WebGL1 if the commonly supported extension is available. Also, luma.gl treats the global vertex array as a \"default\" VertexArrayObject, so that can always be accessed.\n* `Query` objects use GPU timing extensions if available. They can always be created but obviously queries will fail if capabilities are not present.\n* `UniformBufferLayout` - this class does not create any WebGL resources, it just helps the application access memory in the layout format expected by WebGL2 uniform buffers.\n\n`VertexAttributeObject` and `Query` have a static `isSupported()` method that you can call instead of checking for WebGL2.\n\n### WebGL2 Classes that only work in WebGL2\n\nA list of luma classes that can only be instantiated under WebGL2:\n* `Texture3D` - e.g for volumetric rendering\n* `Texture2DArray` - an array of textures, e.g. a texture atlas\n* `Sampler` - holds a separate set of texture sampler parameters\n* `TransformFeedback` - holds a list of output buffers for shaders to write to.\n* `Sync` -\n\nEach of these classes has a static `isSupported()` method that you can call instead of checking for WebGL2.\n\n### WebGL2-only Features\n\nA partial list of features that are only available in WebGL2:\n\n* Non-power-of-2 textures - non-POT textures can have mipmaps in WebGL2\n* Sized texture formats -\n* Integer based texture formats and attributes -\n* Multi-Sampled renderbuffers -\n* Guaranteed texture access in vertex shaders - WebGL1 is not required to support this (although it often does)\n\n\n### GLSL 3.00\n\n* `textureSize` - query **size of texture** from within shaders\n* `texelFetch` - access textures by **pixel** coordinates (0-width, 0-height) instead of **texel** coordinates (0-1)\n* `inverse` and `transpose` Matrix operations available in GLSL\n* loop restrictions removed\n\n\n### Optional Feature Detection\n\nThe WebGL standard comes with an elaborate \"extension\" system allowing applications to check for the availability of features beyond the base WebGL1 and WebGL2 standards. These extensions tend to be rather technical, plus they have to be used differently in WebGL1 and WebGL2, so luma provides a simplified feature detection system. Following table lists all the available features, and their support under WebGL1 and WebGL2 , `NO` implies not supported, 'YES' implies supported and `*` implies supported through an extension.\n\nParameters to `hasFeatures`:\n\n| `FEATURE`                             | WebGL2  | WebGL1 | Description |\n| ---                                   | ---     | ---    | ---         |\n| **General WebGL Features**            |         |        | |\n| `FEATURES.WEBGL2`                     | **YES** | **NO** | True for WebGL2 Context |\n| `FEATURES.INSTANCED_RENDERING`        | **YES** | *      | Instanced rendering (via instanced vertex attributes) [`ANGLE_instanced_arrays`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ANGLE_instanced_arrays) |\n| `FEATURES.VERTEX_ARRAY_OBJECT`        | **YES** | *      | `VertexArrayObjects` can be created [`OES_vertex_array_object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OES_vertex_array_object) |\n| `FEATURES.ELEMENT_INDEX_UINT32`       | **YES** | *      | 32 bit indices available for `GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER`s [`OES_element_index_uint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OES_element_index_uint) |\n| `FEATURES.BLEND_MINMAX`               | **YES** | *      | `GL.MIN`, `GL.MAX` blending modes are available: [`EXT_blend_minmax`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EXT_blend_minmax) |\n| `FEATURES.TIMER_QUERY`                | *       | *      | [`Query`](/docs/api-reference/webgl/query.md) objects support asynchronous GPU timings [`EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2/), [`EXT_disjoint_timer_query`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EXT_disjoint_timer_query) |\n| **`Texture`s and `Framebuffer`s** |    |        | |\n| `FEATURES.TEXTURE_FLOAT`              | **YES** | *      | Floating point (`Float32Array`) textures can be created and set as samplers (Note that filtering and rendering need to be queried separately, even in WebGL2)  [`OES_texture_float`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OES_texture_float) |\n| `FEATURES.TEXTURE_HALF_FLOAT`         | **YES** |        | Half float (`Uint16Array`) textures can be created and set as samplers [`OES_texture_half_float`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OES_texture_half_float) [`WEBGL_color_buffer_float`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_color_buffer_float) |\n| `FEATURES.MULTIPLE_RENDER_TARGETS`    | **YES** | *      | `Framebuffer`s can have multiple color attachments that fragment shaders can access, see `Framebuffer.drawBuffers` [`WEBGL_draw_buffers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_draw_buffers) |\n| `FEATURES.COLOR_ATTACHMENT_RGBA32F`   | *      | *      | Floating point `Texture`s using the `GL.RGBA32F` format are renderable and readable [`EXT_color_buffer_float`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EXT_color_buffer_float) [`WEBGL_color_buffer_float`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_color_buffer_float) |\n| `FEATURES.COLOR_ATTACHMENT_FLOAT`     | *       | **NO** | Floating point `Texture`s are renderable and readable, i.e. can be attached to `Framebuffer`s and written to from fragment shaders, and read from with `readPixels` etc. Note that the formats include `GL.RGBA32F`.
