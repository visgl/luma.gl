Versions These docs are for luma.gl aims to provide tools for WebGL developers wether they wish to do high or low-level GPU programming. Polyfilling and shader composition utilities, for example, can be used while programming directly with the WebGL API, while resource management utilities provide higher-level 3D engine functionality. The core use case for luma.gl is visualization of large datasets, but its design is generic enough for more general usage. Key strengths of luma.gl include: A WebGL 2-first API  - luma.gl polyfills WebGL 1 contexts insofar as possible to support the WebGL 2 API. This allows applications to code using the latest WebGL 2 APIs while transparently keeping the application backwards compatible with WebGL 1 (using WebGL extensions, shader transpilation and other techniques). Modular, Composable Tools  - It is left to the develop to decide what parts of luma.gl suit their application. Program at a higher level using WebGL wrapper classes or a  Model , or simply polyfill the context and program using the WebGL 2 API. High-performance Data Visualization  - luma.gl focuses on simplifying access to APIs that are particularly useful when visualizing large data sets, such as instanced drawing and transform feedback. For some powerful examples of what can be achieved with luma.gl, take a look at  deck.gl ,  kepler.gl  and  avs.auto . Future We share information about the direction of luma.gl in the following ways: RFCs  - RFCs are technical writeups that describe proposed features in upcoming releases. Roadmap Document  - (this document) A high-level summary of our current direction for future releases. Blog  - We use the vis.gl blog to share information about what we are doing.

Improved vertex array object support in WebGL 1 Handling of platforms that do not support vertex array objects has been significantly improved, providing a more stable experience in IE 11 and headless-gl. GLSL 3.0 to 1.0 transpilation assembleShaders  now optionally attempts to transpile shaders from GLSL 3.0 to 1.0, potentially simplifying shader management in systems where both WebGL 1 and 2 are used. Refer to  the documentation  for more information. Version 8.0 Date: December 16, 2019 Performance The key focus of luma.gl v8.0 was optimizing performance. Compared to v7.3, the latest release shows a  2x  improvement in render time on the luma.gl stress test (1 million textured cubes), as detailed below: 7.3 8.0 Improvement CPU Time 30ms 16ms 14ms (47%) GPU Time 26ms 21ms 5ms (19%) luma.gl's optimizations also contributed significantly to deck.gl's performance gains in v8.0, leading to a  3x  improvement over its prior release on the deck.gl stress test (rendering 100,000  ScatterplotLayer  instances): 7.3 8.0 Improvement CPU Time 76ms 26ms 50ms (66%) GPU Time 17ms 10ms 7ms (41%) Stress tests were run on a Macbook Pro 2018, OSX, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB. Streamlined API luma.gl v8.0 also brings with it a major simplification of the API and streamlining of architecture. The number of modules as been reduced from 14 to 9, each with a clearly defined purpose and relationship to other modules: Low-level constants : WebGL 1 and 2 enums. gltools : Tools for polyfilling, intrumenting and tracking state for WebGL contexts. shadertools : Tools for creating and composing re-usable GLSL shader modules. Mid-level webgl : WebGL 1 and 2 wrapper classes. High-level engine : Higher-level 3D graphics abstractions and resource management. Utilities debug : Debug instrumentation for WebGL contexts and luma.gl classes. test-utils : Testing utilities. core : Selected re-exports from other modules. experimental : Unfinished and unsupported features. Version 7.3 Date: September 19, 2019 Program Management luma.gl introduces the  ProgramManager  class to manage caching and re-use of  Program  objects, providing powerful load and runtime optimizations: Redundant shader compilation and linking is avoided. Redundant program switching (among the  most expensive  GPU state changes) while rendering is avoided. The  Model  class has been updated to take advantage of these new capabilities, automatically caching and re-using  Program s where possible. The table below shows the effect of program sharing in deck.gl. The test renders 1000  ScatterplotLayers , each of which draws 100 intanced geometries, for a total of 1000 draw calls and 100,000 instances. Timings are milliseconds spent on the CPU and GPU to render a single frame on the following two machines: Macbook Pro 2018, OSX, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 560X 4 GB Razer Blade, Windows 10, Intel i7-8750H 6 Core, Intel UHD Graphics 630 No Program Sharing Program Sharing Improvement Macbook Pro CPU 113ms 93ms 17% Macbook Pro GPU 43ms 34ms 20% Razer Blade CPU 145ms 125ms 13% Razer Blade GPU 137ms 115ms 16% Custom Device Pixels (Experimental) luma.gl now provides experimental support for specifying the pixel ratio mapping between canvas size and the GL drawing buffer. luma.gl has always provided support for matching the native device pixel ratio on high-resolution screens, but custom ratios allow applications to, for example, use SSAA for improved fidelity or reduced drawing resolution to improve performance. Version 7.2 Date: July 9, 2019 FXAA Shader Module luma.gl now supports FXAA (Fast Approximate Antialiasing) as a post processing effect. This allows for antialiasing on offscreen framebuffers. ImageBitmap Textures The  Texture  class now supports  ImageBitmap  input data. Version 7.1 Date: June 4, 2019 Enhanced Shader Injection System luma.gl now supports a much more robust system for injecting code into shaders. In addition to the pre-defined shader hooks such as  vs:#main-start ,\nthe shader injection system now supports: Definition of arbitrary shader hook functions that can be called anywhere in a shader Injection of arbitrary code into shader hook functions to modify their behavior Automatic injection by shader modules into hook functions or pre-defined shader hooks The combination of these features allows the behavior of the same shader code to be modified depending on included shader modules or other\nrequirements of the application. See  assembleShaders  documentation for more details. Animation Support More robust animations are now supported via the  Timeline  and  KeyFrames  classes. The  Timeline  class supports easily managing a timeline with multiple channels elapsing at different rates, as well as orchestrating playing, pausing, and rewinding behavior between them. A timeline can be attached to an  AnimationLoop  and then queried for time values, which can be used in animations. See  Timeline  documentation for more details. The  KeyFrames  class allows arbitrary data to be associated with time points. The time value of the key frames can be set and the current key frames and interpolation factor can be queried and used in calculating animated values. See  KeyFrames  documentation for more details. Version 7.0 Date: April 19, 2019 glTF Support luma.gl can now load 3D models and scenegraphs in the popular  glTF™  asset format (with the help of the loaders.gl  GLTFLoader . All variants of glTF 2.0 are supported, including binary  .glb  files as well as JSON  .gltf  files with binary assets in base64 encoding or in separate files. The Draco Mesh compression extension is also supported. Physically-based Material Support : Ensures that PBR models display as intended. Scenegraph Improvements : The Scenegraph classes have been refactored to ensure support for glTF objects. Geometry glTF Support : The  Geometry  class and scene graph support has been overhauled to conform to glTF conventions, simplifying loading and manipulation of glTF formatted data. loaders.gl Integration loaders.gl  is a major new companion framework to luma.gl that provides a suite of 3D file format loaders (with an emphasizis on point cloud formats), including: Draco PLY PCD LAS/LAZ OBJ loaders.gl output can now be passed directly into luma.gl classes like  Geometry  and  Model  making it straightforward to use luma.gl with a wide variety of file formats. Asynchronous Textures Image data for  Texture  classes can now be supplied using URLs or  Promise s, making it unnecessary for applications to handle image loading themselves. Lighting A standardized set of light classes are now supported by multiple material models (Phong, Goraud and PBR) enabling various models to be mixed and properly lit in the same scene. Modularization Improvements luma.gl has been restructured to make it easier for applications to select and import only parts of the library that they use. @luma.gl/gpgpu   New  - A new experimental submodule with GPGPU Algorithms and Utilities has been added, containing a growing collection of GPU accelerated algorithms and utility methods. Performance Instrumentation Extensive metrics about frame CPU and GPU times, resource counts, and GPU memory usage are being collected. The data is exposed as a  probe.gl   Stats  object. The new probe.gl  StatsWidget  can be used to present data in applications. Interleaved Attributes To improve support for interleaved attributes and glTF model loading, accessor objecs and the  Accessor  class now support a  buffer  field. In addition, attribute setting functions now accept accessor objects with the  buffer  field set. This allows multiple accessor objects referencing the same buffer: Unified functions for Framebuffers and Textures (Read/Copy/Blit) A set of global methods that perform copying data to and from  Framebuffer  objects. All functions that read from or write to a  Framebuffer  object now also accept a  Texture  object (no need to create and configure a  Framebuffer  just to do a simple operation on a  Texture ). Experimental Features WebVR Support (experimental) Just replace your  AnimationLoop  with  VRAnimationLoop  from  @luma.gl/addons . Works with  Firefox Reality . Version 6.4 Date: January 29, 2018 PBR (Physically Based) Rendering and Material Physically-Based Rendering is now supported and the new  PBRMaterial  class can be used to set up parameters. Material can be selected per model. Copy and Blit methods Several member function of  Framebuffer  and  Texture  classes are now replaced by global methods that peform copying data to and from  Framebuffer  objects. All methods that read from or write to a  Framebuffer  object, can now also accept a  Texture  object. Version 6.3 Date: November 16, 2018 Uniform Caching Uniforms are now cached at  Program  object, which improves performance by eliminating uniform setter calls when uniform values are not changed. New submodules @luma.gl/debug  - an experimental module for debugging WebGL shaders on CPU @luma.gl/glfx  - shader modules for image processing Offscreen Rendering (Experimental) A new experimental class  AnimationLoopProxy  supports running an  AnimationLoop  on a worker thread using the  OffscreenCanvas  API made official in Chrome 70. For more detatils, see  API documentation  and  example app . Version 6.2 Date: September 12, 2018 ShaderModulePass (Experimental) Shader modules that expose \"standard\" filtering and sampling functions can be given extra metadata (the  passes  field) enabling easy construction of a  ShaderModulePass . Look for  ShaderPass  badges in the documentation of shader modules. Transform Texture support (Experimental) Transform  class was introduced in 6.0 provides easy API to perform WebGL's complicated  TransformFeedback . We are now extending this class to provide same easy API to read and write into textures. Running image filters, performing offline rendering and custom texture mip-map generation are some of the use-cases. Moreover, texture and buffer access can be combined, i.e. using single  Transform  instance buffers can be captured using  TransformFeedback  and data can be propagated beyond vertex shader to generate a texture. Version 6.1 Date: Target August 31, 2018 luma.gl 6.1 is a minor release that introduces a number of new experimental capabilities that are expected to be built out and become official over the next few releases. New Multipass Rendering System (Experimental) luma.gl now provides a composable multipass rendering framework, based on a  MultiPassRenderer  class that accepts a list of render passes. Post-Processing Effects (Experimental) A number of classic WebGL/OpenGL post processing effects have been ported to luma.gl and packaged as composable render passes. For maxiumum flexibility, many of the underlying shaders have also been exposed as shader modules, allowing filtering features to be used either directly in existing shaders or applied as a post-processing filter. New loaders.gl Submodule (Experimental) A selection of open source 3D loaders have been ported to a new submodule  loaders.gl . Initial focus is on point cloud loaders (PLY, LAZ, PCD), although a geospatial loader (KML) is also included. In addition it contains both read and write support for GLB (the glTF binary container format). Transform Class now supports Shader Modules The  Transform  class now accepts shader module parameters (such as  modules ,  dependencies  and  inject , see  assembleShaders ), enabling the use of shader modules in transform feedback operations. Documentation Search luma.gl is now using the  ocular  document generator to build its website, which among other things enables search. Version 6.0 Date: July 18, 2018 A major release that as always focuses on WebGL performance and code size optimizations, better support for shader/GLSL programming, improved documentation and API cleanup. WebGL Improvements Attribute Management Optimizations VertexArray  objects are now used for all attribute management in luma.gl, resulting in improved performance and a simpler, more consistent API. The  Program  and  Model  class APIs have been updated to use  VertexArray . Buffer Memory Optimizations The  Buffer  class no longer holds on to the complete JavaScript typed arrays used during initialization. This can lead to significant memory savings in apps that use multiple large GPU buffers initialized from typed arrays. Also for convenience a new method  getElementCount  is added that returns number elements based on its size and type. Transform Feedback Improvements A new method  Model.transform  makes it easier to run basic transform feedback operations, when the full power of the new  Transform  class (see below) is not needed. Transform class (WebGL 2) Transform  is now an officially supported luma.gl class. This new class provides an easy-to-use interface to Transform Feedback. This class hides complexity by internally creating and managing the supporing WebGL objects that are necessary to perform Transform Feedback operations. Shader Module System Improvements GLSL Transpilation The shader assembler now transforms shader code to the GLSL version specified by the top-level shader. GLSL 3.00 ES shader code is transparently transformed into GLSL 1.00 ES compatible code when needed, and vice versa. This allows application to write shader code in the modern GLSL version available (3.00 ES) and still run it under WebGL 1 - Shader \"transpilation\" will automatically convert shader module source code syntax to the target version (assuming that no WebGL 2 only features were used). Shader Code Injection A new shader injection system allows applications to inject additional code into existing shaders. In many cases, this can avoid the need to copy (or \"fork\") large and complicated existing shaders just to add a few lines of code. Shader injection can be used to \"inject\" new shader modules into an existing shader. Adding a shader module to the modules list automatically \"prepends\" the shader module functions to the beginning of your main shader code, but using a shader module still typically requires adding one or two lines of code each to the main functions in the vertex and fragment shaders. In many cases, the new shader injection feature allows this be done without copying the original shaders. Shader Modules now support GLSL 3.00 ES All shader modules are now written in GLSL 3.00 syntax, and leverage the new GLSL transpilation feature to be compatible with both GLSL 3.00 ES and GLSL 1.00 ES main shaders. Care is taken to avoid using GLSL 3.00 specific features whenever possible, and exceptions will be clearly documented. Documentation Developer's Guide luma.gl now has a more extensive Developer's Guide covering more areas of the API, including a new developer guide for shader programming, with sections about writing shaders and the shader module system. Content includes: Guidelines for writing shaders that work in both GLSL 3.00 ES and GLSL 1.00 ES A new GLSL language reference page describing both GLSL 3.00 ES and GLSL 1.00 ES (as well as what has changed between them) in a single place. API Cleanup Being a major release, in v6.0 we took the opportunity to clean up the luma.gl API. Removal of Deprecated/Unused Methods To keep reducing application bundle size, a number of methods have been removed from the luma.gl API. Methods that were deprecated in previous releases have now been removed, and in additional a number of rarely used methods have also been dropped (in most cases, the dropped functionality is still accessible using raw WebGL calls). Renamed Methods In a few cases, methods have been renamed after API Audits, usually to improve API consistency. The details are listed in the Upgrade Guide. In most cases, running your pre-v6 application on v6 should generate messages in the console when old method calls are encountered, and you should be able to quickly address any changes one-by-one by referring to the Upgrade Guide. Version 5.3 Date: June 1, 2018 A minor release with bug fixes and internal improvements. Version 5.2 Date: Apr 24, 2018 Transform class (WebGL 2, Experimental) The new experimental  Transform  class provides an easy-to-use interface to perform Transform Feedback operations. Framebuffer Class Pixel Readback to GPU Buffers  (WebGL 2) - A new method  Framebuffer.readPixelsToBuffer  is added to asynchronously read pixel data into a  Buffer  object. This allows applications to reduce the CPU-GPU sync time by postponing transfer of data or to completely avoid GPU-CPU sync by using the pixel data in the GPU  Buffer  object directly as data source for another GPU draw or transform feedback operation. Bundle Size Reduction The impact of importing luma.gl on production application bundle sizes has been reduced, in particular when using webpack 4 with appropriate configuration. A new article about  bundling and tree shaking  has been added to the Developer Guide, providing in-depth information and guidance on what numbers to expect. Running luma.gl in Node.js Running of luma.gl under Node.js is now easier than ever. luma.gl v5.2 automatically loads headless-gl if installed on the system, avoiding the need for the app to import special files or add other conditional logic. See  Using with Node  and the Upgrade Guide. Debug Mode Changes To further reduce production application bundle sizes, luma.gl no longer support WebGL debug contexts by default, as this requires including the Khronos  WebGLDeveloperTools  into the bundle. WebGL debug contexts are still available, but needs to be explicitly enabled. To understand how to use WebGL debug contexts in v5.2, please refer to the article on  Debugging  and the Upgrade Guide. Examples All examples have been updated to use webpack 4 Version 5.1 A smaller release with improvements to  TransformFeedback  support. Date: Feb 15, 2018 TransformFeedback Class Two improvements Performing Transform Feedback operations has gotten easier, mainly in the following two ways: TransformFeedback  instances can now be supplied directly to  Model.draw  and feedback will begin and end during that draw call. Thus it is no longer necessary to work directly with the  Program  class to use transform feedback. Program  now build a  varyingMap  on creation depending on  varyings  array and  drawMode . This  varyingMap  can be passed to  TransformFeedback.bindBuffers()  enabling buffers to be indexed by the name of the \"varying\" instead of using an index. For more details check  TransformFeedback  and  Model  documentation. Version 5.0 Date: Dec 22, 2017 A smaller release with several new examples and some under the hood changes to improve performance. Examples Additional examples have been ported to the luma.gl v5 API. Lesson 10 Lesson 11 Lesson 12 Lesson 13 Model Class Model.draw  now supports a  moduleSettings  parameters to update shader module settings. Model.render  now supports  attributes  and  samplers  arguments to be used for drawing. Framebuffer Binding Management In v4 we added WebGL state management which automatically tracks all WebGL state settings. In this release we extended this feature to support framebuffer bindings. When restoring context settings, the previous framebuffer binding will also be restored. WebGL 2 Improvements Improvements in particular to the  Buffer ,  TransformFeedback  and  Framebuffer  classes based on use in applications. Shader Modules fp64  - fp64 module works under more platforms/GPUs/drivers picking  shader module is moved from deck.gl to luma.gl and has been enhanced to also support object highlighting. Version 4.0 Release date: July 27th, 2017 A major release that brings full WebGL 2 support to luma.gl, as well as adding support for GL state management and a new shader module system. Full WebGL 2 Support luma.gl now exposes the complete WebGL 2 APIs: New classes expose all the new WebGL 2 objects ( Query ,  Texture3D , and  TransformFeedback ), together with a new  UniformBufferLayout  helper class to make uniform buffers easy to use. Other existing WebGL classes with new functionalites under WebGL 2 have been updated. Add new WebGL 2 texture formats and types support, including floating point textures, and multiple render targets. WebGL Capability Management luma.gl provides a single unified WebGL 2-style API across WebGL 2, WebGL 1 and WebGL extensions, and provides a simple mechanisms for querying what capabilities are available. This simplifies building apps that run on both WebGL 1 and WebGL 2, seamlessly allowing applications to leverage WebGL extensions when available. WebGL State Management In this version, a new WebGL state management is implemented to help address one of the weak spots of the stateful WebGL API: luma.gl can track certain WebGL context state changes so the app could easily set and reset WebGL states for certain operations. luma.gl also has a host-side WebGL state caching system that records certain WebGL states so that expansive queries into the GPU or underlying OpenGL driver won't be necessary. shadertools - A New Shader Module System The new, optional, shadertools module with the  assembleShaders  function system allows shader code to be broken into composable pieces. A new  ShaderCache  class is provided to ensure that identical shaders are only compiled once and no unnecessary examination and/or checks are done on already compiled WebGL shader and program objects, which significantly accelerates app start up under some occasions. Documentation Improvements Complete rewrite of luma.gl's documentation. New structure and contents for every classes provided, featured on a new website with links to other frameworks in Uber's visualization framework suite, such as deck.gl and react-map-gl. Code Size Improvements Significant reduction in the size of distributed luma.gl library Code Size - luma.gl is continuously being tuned for code size. Deprecated Code Removed - Removal of deprecated features to help reduce library size. Tree Shaking support - special care have been taken to avoid so called \"side effects\" that defeat dependency analysis during tree shaking). v3.0 Release Date: March 15, 2017 A smaller release mainly intended to align the luma.gl code base with the big deck.gl v4 release. Major News Examples Examples converted to ES6 to better showcase the luma.gl API. Debug Support Now uses  WEBGL_debug_shaders  extension when available to log translated shader source code. Performance queries, using  EXT_disjoint_timer_query  and  EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2  to provide timings. New  AnimationFrame  class Wraps requestAnimationFrame on browser and Node.js Supports initialization promises (wait for HTML body (canvas) to load, wait for texture images to load, etc). Supplies common uniforms to the frame render function:  width ,  height ,  aspect ,  tick ,  time  etc. Smaller changes Fix glTypeToArray to use  Uint8ClampedArrays  by default Add CORS setting to allow loading image from a different domain New  gl-matrix  based math library Optional library: All math operations directly accept JavaScript arrays Math classes are subclasses of JavaScript arrays (i.e. not {x,y,z} objects)\nand can thus be used interchangeably with arrays. Relies on  gl-matrix  for computations. Adds optional error checking. Offers more control over details like printing precision etc. Library Size Reorganized to only export a minimal surface of functions/classes. Tree-shaking support (package.json module keyword and dist-es6 distribution) Significant reduction of module dependencies. Experimental APIs shader-modules ,  shader-tools ,  shaders  shader module system added to  /experimental probe  moved to  /experimental Deprecations/Deletions Old math lib deprecated. FBO  class deprecated (use  Framebuffer  directly). Camera  class deprecated, use math library directly. Scene  class deprecated, for effects use - TBD Internal improvements Replace wildcard exports with named exports in index.js ES6 Conformant code base: stage-2 extensions removed Webpack based build Multiple examples now work standalone Experimental tree-shaking support: dist and dist-es6 directories Dependency removal, including removal of  autobind-decorator  dependency Changed precommit hook from  husky  to  pre-commit webgl  folder now contains both webgl1 and webgl2 classes Breaking Changes BREAKING CHANGE: Move node IO (loadImage etc) out of main src tree and into  packages . This allows luma.gl to drop a number of big dependencies. The node IO code may be published as a separate module later. v2.0 Release Date: July 05, 2016 (evolved through a number of minor releases) Theme: A bigger official release, a major API refactoring that introduced the WebGL classes that are now a characteristic aspect of the luma.gl API. Major Features CHANGE: Removes glslify as a dependency, apps that depend on glslify must add it to their own package.json. TimerQuery Support EXT_disjoint_timer_query. Debug Support Built-in attribute/uniform logging GLSL shader compiler error handling Linux support Add missing call to getAttribLocation. New gl-matrix based math classes Move old math lib to deprecated folder. Move FBO to deprecated folder. Examples converted to ES6. AnimationFrame class updates. Add back persistence example WebGL type and constant cleanup Fix glTypeToArray and use clamped arrays by default TimerQuery, WebGL Extension doc, fix crash on Travis CI Support EXT_disjoint_timer_query Document luma.gl use of WebGL extensions. Fix: context creation crash when WEBGL_debug_info extension was undefined Debug log improvements, import fix Debug logs now print unused attributes more compactly, number formatting improved. Add ability to import luma without io import \"luma.gl/luma\" will import luma without io functions import \"luma.gl/io\" will import luma io functions only omitting io functions significantly reduces dependencies Makes the luma object available in console for debugging. Some polish on luma's built-in attribute/uniform logging Node.js/AttributeManager/Renderer/Program.render()/Examples Ensure luma.gl does not fail under node until createGLContext is called. Program.render() now takes a map of uniforms, reducing need to \"set\" uniforms before render. New experimental Renderer class -  requestAnimationFrame  replacement. Improvement/fixes to examples Node.js support Ensure luma.gl does not fail under node until createGLContext is called. luma global initialization Makes the luma object available in console for debugging. Makes optional headless support more reliable. Headless support Removed  gl  (headless-gl) dependency, to simplify build and setup for applications that don't use headless-gl. import 'luma.gl/headless'  and  npm install gl  to get headless integration. Improve change detection Redraw flag management improvements Decoupled headless-gl dependency It is now necessary to import luma.gl through  luma.gl/headless  to get headless integration.

We'll use luma.gl's built-in geometry primitives to create a cube mesh and handle 3D math using  math.gl .  math.gl  can be installed by running  npm i math.gl As always, we'll start with our imports: Our shaders are somewhat more involved that we've seen before: The two biggest additions to the shaders we've seen before are transforming the positions to rotate our model and create the 3D perspective effect (via the  uMVP  matrix) and sampling a texture to color fragments (via the  texture2D  call). The set up to render in 3D involves a few extra steps compared to the triangles we've been drawing so far: Some of the new techniques we're leveraging here are: Using  setParameters  to set up depth testing and ensure surfaces occlude each other properly. Compared to setting these parameters directly, the  setParameters  function has the advantage of tracking state and preventing redundant WebGL calls. Creating a texture using the  Texture2D  class. For our purposes, this is as simple as passing a URL to the image location (the image used in this tutorial is available  here , but any JPEG or PNG image will do). Creating view and MVP matrices using  math.gl 's  Matrix4  class to store the matrices we'll pass to our shaders to perform the animation and perspective projection. Generating attribute data using the  CubeGeometry  class and passing it to our  Model  using the  geometry  property. The geometry will automatically feed vertex position data into the  positions  attribute and texture coordinates (or UV coordinates) into the  texCoords  attribute. Our  onRender  is similar to what we've seen before with the extra step of setting up the transform matrix and passing it as a uniform to the  Model : We use  Matrix4 's matrix operations to create our final transformation matrix, taking advantage of a few additional parameters that are passed to the  onRender  method: aspect  is the aspect ratio of the canvas and is used to set up the perspective projection. tick  is simply a counter that increments each frame. We use it to drive the rotation animation. If all went well, you should see a rotating cube with the Uber Visualization logo painted on each side. The live demo is available  here , and the full source code is listed below for reference:","headings":[{"value":"Hello Cube","depth":1}],"slug":"docs/getting-started/hello-cube","title":"Hello Cube"},{"excerpt":"Upgrade Guide Upgrading from v8.4 to v8.5 Transpilation The module entry point is now only lightly transpiled for the most commonly used evergreen browsers. This change offers significant savings on bundle size. If your application needs to support older browsers such as IE 11, make sure to include  node_modules  in your babel config. Upgrading from v7.3 to v8.0 The key goals of luma.gl v8.0 were to simplify the core architecture and significantly improve performance. The number of modules has been reduced from 14 to 9, and they are now structured around layers of abstraction (high-level to low-level) to clarify the relationship between them. Unfinished and rarely-used components have been removed, reducing the complexity of the API and leading to significant performance gains (see  What's New ) for details). Module Restructure The module structure has been significantly changed for v8.0 with the intention of clarifying the purpose of each module and the relationships between them. New Module Purpose Components from v7 constants WebGL enum values Same as before shadertools Tools for manipulating and composing shader text shadertools and effects (formerly glfx) gltools Creation, tooling and polyfilling for the WebGL context webgl2-polyfill and webgl-state-tracker webgl Wrapper classes for WebGL Same as before core Single module re-exporting key parts of engine, webgl, gltools, shadertools Changes described below engine High-level drawing APIs core/model, core/animation-loop, core/resource-management, addons/animation, core/geometry, core/transform debug Debug tooling for the other modules Same as before test-utils Test tooling for the other modules Same as before experimental Experimental, unsupported APIs core/scenegraph, gpgpu, addons/gltf, addons/webvr Breaking changes Texture2D 's  unpackFlipY  option is removed. This change ensures that all data sources (Image, ImageBitmap, typed array) are treated consistently. As a result, textures created from Image objects and URL strings are now y-flipped from the v7.3 default. To get the old behavior, specify the  pixelStore  option: createGLContext  will no longer attempt to create a headlessgl context under node.js. One can either create headless context externally and use  instrumentGLContext  to prepare it for use with luma.gl or use  createHeadlessContext  from  @luma.gl/test-utils  to create a headlessgl context. registerShaderModules  has been removed. Modules can be imported and used directly where necessary. createShaderHook  and  createModuleInjection  have been removed. Use  ProgramManager.getDefaultProgramManger(gl).addShaderHook  && the shader module  inject field  instead. ProgramManager.getDefaultProgramManger(gl).addModuleInjection  been removed. Use the shader module  inject field  instead. getParameter  and  setParameter  have been removed. Use  getParameters  and  setParameters  instead. The following are no longer exported by @luma.gl/core, but can still be imported from the modules indicated: Available in Query, VertexArrayObject, VertexArray, UniformBufferLayout, Shader, VertexShader, FragmentShader, clearBuffer, clearBuffer, copyToDataUrl, copyToImage, blit, setPathPrefix, loadFile, loadImage @luma.gl/webgl resizeGLContext @luma.gl/gltools combineInjects, lights, getQualifierDetails, getPassthroughFS, typeToChannelSuffix, typeToChannelCount, convertToVec4 @luma.gl/shadertools Smaller changes Functions are no longer accepted as uniform values to the  Model  class. The same effect can be achieved by updating the uniform values each frame prior to drawing. BaseModel  and  Model  have been consolidated in  Model .  Model  can be used as a substitute for  BaseModel  where necessary. AmbientLight ,  DirectionalLight ,  PointLight ,  PhongMaterial ,  PBRMaterial ,  CameraNode  have been removed from @luma.gl/core. These were either empty classes or simple data objects and so can be replaced by plain JavaScript objects in most cases. ShaderCache  has been removed and superseded by  ProgramManager . VertexArray.getDrawParams  no longer takes overrides as an argument. The calling function can manually override values as needed. @luma.gl/main has been removed. Use individual modules instead. Multipass  classes have been removed. Seer support has been removed. Timeline and Keyframes have been moved from @luma.gl/addons to @luma.gl/engine. Upgrading from v7.2 to v7.3 ProgramManager  has replaced  ShaderCache  in the  Model  class as a more robust resource manager. Use of the  ShaderCache  with  Model  will not affect functionality in any way, but it is now a no-op. Upgrading from v6.x to v7.0 luma.gl v7.0 represents a major overhaul of the API. The majority of changes are in areas that are only infrequently used by applications, and the intention is that most applications should only require very light porting. Core API Removals Loading Functions Removed Extensive loading functionality is now provided by a new companion framework  loaders.gl  and because of this, most of the limited legacy luma.gl loading functions have been removed. For the most common case (loading of images for use with textures), loading functions are no longer needed as the  data  prop in the  Texture2D  constructor now accepts url strings and  Promise  objects (this is the new Async Textures function). Removed Function Replacement loadTexture(url, parameters) new Texture(gl, {data: url, parameters}) loadFiles Multiple calls to  loadFile loadImages Multiple calls to  loadImage loadTextures As per  loadTexture loadProgram Manually load  fs  and  vs , call  new Program(gl, {vs, fs}) loadModel call  loadFile  and copy  parseModel  code from examples/lesson/16 parseModel call  loadFile  and copy  parseModel  code from examples/lesson/16 Attribute Class Removed This experimental class has been moved to deck.gl and is now an internal class. Attribute accessor API improvements in luma.gl v7 should cover any issue. WebGL API Removals Sampler Class Removed The  Sampler  class has been removed as its utility was limited and it added complexity to the library. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises. Texture2DArray Class Removed The  Texture2DArray  class has been removed as its utility was limited and the status of support was unclear due to limited testing. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises. FenceSync Class Removed The  FenceSync  class has been removed as its utility was limited. It may be added back in the future if a clear use case arises. If required, syncing can be done directly through the  WebGLFenceSync  object. Framebuffer and Texture: Copy and Blit methods Following member function of  Framebuffer  and  Texture  classes are no longer supported, instead use the corresponding new global methods: Removed method Replacement Framebuffer.readPixels readPixelsToArray Framebuffer.readPixelsToBuffer readPixelsToBuffer Frambuffer.copyToDataUrl copyToDataUrl Frambuffer.copyToImage copyToImage Frambuffer.copyToTexture copyToTexture Frambuffer.blit blit Texture.copyFramebuffer copyToTexture Parameters have also changed in some cases, see separate section. Module Structure Changes Debug functionality moved to separate npm module To reduce bundle size and increase separation of concerns, debug functionality is now more cleanly separated from the core library and needs to be imported from a separate npm module: To upgrade, install the new module And replace with Model Changes: Model  no longer extends  ScenegraphNode . This ensures that applications that do not need scenegraph support do not need to include scenegraph related code. Use the new  ModelNode  class to inject  Models  into scenegraphs. Deletions: Redraw flag handling has been removed:  Model.setNeedsRedraw()  and  Model.getNeedsRedraw() . Additions: A new  Model.isAnimated()  method is provided, indicating that redraws are required every frame. Geometry The  Geometry  class has been simplified and is now a conceptually \"immutable\" class that holds typed arrays and accessor metatadata describing attributes for a geometry. Removal Replacement Reason for Change Geometry.drawMode  no longer accepts  String  values Geometry.DRAW_MODE  enum API simplification Geometry.setNeedsRedraw() N/A Not needed for immutable geometry Geometry.getNeedsRedraw() N/A Not needed for immutable geometry Buffer Removed Method Replacement Reason for Change Buffer.updateAccessor(...) Buffer.setAccessor(new Accessor(buffer.accessor, ...) Decoupling accessors from  Buffer Framebuffer To maximize rendering performance, the default framebuffer is no longer preserved between frames. The most common use case for preserving the draw buffer is capturing canvas contents into an image via  toDataURL . This can now be done via  AnimationLoop.toDataURL  which returns a  Promise  that resolves to the canvas data URL: More generally, moving code that depends on canvas contents to the end of  onRender , after all draw operations, will ensure that canvas contents are available. Prior behaviour can re-enabled using the  glOptions  argument to the  createGLContext  or  AnimationLoop  constructors: Note that setting  preserveDrawingBuffers  may result in a performance drop on some platforms. Query Use  Query.getTimerMilliseconds  to retrieve timer results in milliseconds.  Query.getResult  now returns raw query results. To improve performance and simplify the library, support for tracking  Query  instances with promises has changed: The  Query  constructor no longer takes  onComplete  and  onError  callbacks, and  pollGLContext  has been removed. Instead  Query.createPoll  now provides a simple, optional promise-based API. Copy And Blit Parameter Unification Names of certain parameters to these methods have been unified in an effort to reduce confusion and use the same conventions across all functions implementing image read-back, copy or blit.

Simply create a  Model  or  ModelNode  and explicitly pass a  Geometry  instance as\nan argument, e.g.: Upgrading from v5.3 to v6.0 luma.gl v6.0 underwent a major API cleanup, resulting in a smaller, easier-to-learn API and smaller application bundles. While there are many smaller changes, the impact on most applications should be limited: Most removed functions were in practice rarely used by applications, and the impact on typical luma.gl applications should be limited. A number of API changes are related to moving attribute management from  Program  to  VertexArray , however for higher level applications that work with the  Model  class rather than  Program  directly, there should not be much impact. GL Constants Import Path The biggest change for many apps will probably be that the static  GL  symbol (that contains all WebGL 2 constants) must now be separately imported GL from 'luma.gl/constants'. Experimental Exports: New Naming Convention Experimental exports are now prefixed with underscore ( _ ). The  experimental  \"name space\" export has been removed. This change will enable tree-shaking bundlers to remove unused experimental exports, resulting in smaller final application bundles. Removed symbols Math functions were moved from luma.gl to the separate math.gl module in v4.1. As of v6.0, they are no longer forwarded by luma.gl and now need to be imported directly from math.gl: luma.gl v6.0 removes a number of previously deprecated symbols. luma.gl will now issue an error rather than a warning if the old usage is detecated. Constants Removed symbol Replacement Reason for change GL import GL from 'luma.gl/constants' Bundle size reduction (by making this import optional). glGet(name) glGet(gl, name) Bundle size reduction (Was deprecated in v5.3) glKey(value) glKey(gl, value) Bundle size reduction (Was deprecated in v5.3) glKeyType(value) glKeyType(gl, value) Bundle size reduction (Was deprecated in v5.3) Context Removed symbol Replacement Reason for change deleteGLContest destroyGLContext Naming audit (Was deprecated in v5.3) pollContext pollGLContext Naming audit (Was deprecated in v5.3) trackContextCreation N/A Rarely used, overly specialized Global Functions Removed symbol Replacement Reason for change readPixels Framebuffer.readPixels Naming audit (was deprecated in v3.0) FrameBufferObject FrameBuffer Naming audit (was deprecated in v3.0) AnimationLoop Removed symbol Replacement Reason for change AnimationLoop.setViewParams() AnimationLoop.setProps() Naming audit Program Removed symbol Replacement Reason for change varyingMap N/A ( configuration ) Program now auto discovers varyings.

You can now simply remove any such import statements from your code. Using Debug Contexts Debugging : The Khronos group's  WebGLDeveloperTools  are automatically installed when luma.gl is installed, but are not actually bundled into the application unless explicitly imported. This avoids impacting the size of production bundles built on luma.gl that typically do not need debug support. To use debug support, first import the debug tools, then call  getDebugContext  to create a debug contexts from a normal WebGL context: Upgrading from v4 to v5 Please read this documentation before upgrading your luma.gl dependency from v4 to v5. In v5 a number of previously deprecated features have been removed and a number of additional deprecations have been made at the same time. Before upgrading to v5, it is highly recommended to run your application using latest v4 release, and check the console for any deprecated warnings, if there are any replace deprecated API with newer API as listed below. Model Class The  Model  constructor expects a gl context as the first argument. Following style construction was deprecated in v4 and is now removed in v5. useDevicePixelRatio useDevicePixelRatio  is used as a an argument in  AnimationLoop  class constructor and  pickModels  method. It is now deprecated in v5, but still supported with a warning message and will be removed in next major version update. It is recommended to use  useDevicePixels  instead. Geometry Geometry  class construction with inline attributes was deprecated in v4 and now removed in v5. All attributes should be grouped inside  attribute  object.

This change is because luma.gl v4 emphasizes sharing shaders rather than programs (often indirectly via shader caching / shader assembly), it is less common that a gl context is available.

This essentially means writing our app using the WebGL API directly, using only a few low-level helper functions to manage shaders and polyfilling. We'll need to install the  gltools  module so we can get a polyfilled context without the  AnimationLoop : Now we can update the imports: Since we aren't using the  AnimationLoop , we'll create our canvas and get a WebGL context directly: Note that we're creating a WebGL 1 context here. This will allow us to demonstrate the polyfilling. Creating our program is  a little  more verbose than before: Next we'll create our vertex array: Wait a minute... we're calling  createVertexArray  and  bindVertexArray  on a WebGL 1 context. But those functions aren't part of the WebGL 1 API! How is this working? The function  polyfillContext  that we used when creating our context will use WebGL extensions that are available to implement WebGL 2 functions on a WebGL 1 context. So we can just program against the WebGL 2 API! Well... mostly... Polyfilling will only work if the necessary extensions are available. And some WebGL 2 features like occlusion queries and transform feedback simply aren't supported by polyfills. Moving on... setting up the vertex array, concise as always in WebGL: And then we set up our draw loop: If all went well, you should see the same scene as drawn by the high- and mid-level apps: four triangles of different colors. See the live demo  here . We simply used luma.gl's  shadertools  and  gltools  to provide polyfilled instanced drawing and compose our shaders from modules. The full code for the app is available below:","headings":[{"value":"Hello Instancing (Low-level)","depth":1}],"slug":"docs/getting-started/hello-instancing-low","title":"Hello Instancing (Low-level)"},{"excerpt":"Shader Hooks In the  previous tutorial , we used shader modules to insert re-usable functions into the shaders that use them. In this tutorial, we'll focus on another feature of shader modules: the ability to modify the behavior of shaders that use them via  shader hooks . A shader hook is simply a function inserted into a vertex or fragment shader. By default, these functions will be no-ops, but they define entry points into which shader modules can inject code. For high-level API usage, shader hooks are exposed via  ProgramManagers  (we'll look at low-level shader hooks later): Shader modules can then inject code into the hook via their  inject  property: We'll use these features to create a modified version of the previous tutorial, using shader hooks and modules to modify the behavior of a single set of vertex and fragment shaders. We'll start by setting up our imports and defining our base vertex and fragment shaders: Here we have a shader hook function,  OFFSET_POSITION , called in our vertex shader. Next we'll create two shader modules that insert code into the shader hook: These shader modules inject code into the shader hook that will modify the x-coordinate of the position passed in. The  inject  property maps shader hook names to the code to be injected into them. The  vs  prefix indicates that this is a vertex shader hook. The  onInitialize  method of our  AnimationLoop  will be somewhat different from the previous example. To create a shader hook, we need access to a  ProgramManager  instance: The shader hook definition is the function signature with a prefix indicating whether it is intended for the vertex shader ( vs ) or fragment shader ( fs ). Shader hooks are always  void  funtions so they must return values to the caller via  out  or  inout  argurments. The rest of  onInitialize  is similar to what we've seen before with the exception of using the new shader modules and the  ProgramManager  to create our  Model s: The  onRender  method is the same as before. If all went well, a blue trangle and a red triangle should be drawn side-by-side on the canvas. The code injected by the modules into the shader hook is what offsets each triangle to the left or right. See the live demo  here . Shader hooks allowed us to define our vertex and fragment shaders once and modify their behavior based on the shader module included.

We'll also take this opportunity to introduce luma.gl shader modules. We'll begin with our  hello triangle  app and make some modifications. First let's create a shader module: A shader module is essentially just some GLSL code that will be inserted into our vertex and fragment shaders. They're usually used to define functions that implement generic functionality that can be reused in different programs. In this case, we're defining one to simply pass a color from the vertex shader to the fragment shader in a varying. This module also demonstrates a common convention in luma.gl to prefix function and variable names in a shader module with the name of the module to avoid name collisions. Now let's update our vertex and fragment shaders to use the module functions: Now we update the  Model  to use the module: If you rerun the app, it should render as it did before. Now let's add some instancing to this scene! First we'll modify the position and color buffers we created before, and add an offset buffer to set the position of each instance: For this scene, the positions are vertex attributes, while the colors and offsets are instance attributes. Now add the offsets to the vertex shader: Finally, we need to add the new buffer to the  Model , and describe the parameters of the instanced draw: Note the new syntax used for the attributes. The second element in each array is an  accessor  that describes how the buffer should be traversed during a draw. luma.gl will try to infer these parameters from the data or the shader when possible, but when it can't (or when we want to override the inferred values), we have to provide an explicit accessor. We also provide the model with the number of instances we want to draw. If all went well, running the app now should draw four triangles, each a different color. See the live demo  here .

So far, we have either created a WebGL context ourselves to use with low-level APIs, or allowed the the  AnimationLoop  class to create a WebGL context for us. luma.gl's higher-level APIs expect some instrumentation on the WebGL context, so we can't just use a context we create ourselves with classes like  Model  and  Buffer . The  AnimationLoop  class performs this instrumentation for us using the  instrumentGLContext  function from  @luma.gl/gltools , and we can use this function directly if we want to control creation of the context or use a context passed to us by another framework (e.g. the  GeoSpatial  example uses this technique with a WebGL context created by  MapboxGL ). We'll create a modified version of the  Hello Triangle  tutorial that creates a WebGL context manually rather than using the  AnimationLoop  class. To start with, we'll modify our imports: We then create our context and pass it to  instrumentGLContext : This performs some polyfilling (done by  polyfillContext , which we saw in the  Hello Instancing Low-level tutorial ) and tracks some additional metadata on the context, ensuring it will work properly with the rest of luma.gl. With that done, we simply create our luma.gl objects and draw as we did in the original example, with the sole difference being we create our own render loop using  requestAnimationFrame  rather than using the  AnimationLoop  callbacks. If all went well, a tri-color triangle should render as it did in the  Hello Triangle  example.

Whew! This will build on the  previous tutorial , so it might be helpful to start with its source code. We'll be drawing 4 instanced cubes, textured and lit in the same way as in the lighting tutorial, but with the animations updated by transform feedback. The  Transform  class is the only addition we need for our imports: The vertex shader for our transform feedback is quite simple. It just increments a scalar rotation value on each run: In order to handle rotation updates in the transform feedback, we have to move construction of the rotation matrix into the vertex shader. We'll use an  axis-angle , passing the axis and rotation angle as instanced attributes (with the rotation angles being updated by transform feedback): We also pass an  offsets  instanced attribute to position each cube. Our fragment shader doesn't change at all: Our  onInitialize  method will need several updates. First we create buffers for our instanced data: The  offsetBuffer  sets positions so the cubes will be in a square formation. The  axisBuffer  looks more complicated, but its simply a set of 4 normalized vectors about which we'll rotate our cubes. Finally, the  rotationBuffer  simply starts with 4 random angles between 0 and 2 π . The  Transform  is straightforward to set up, simply taking the  rotationBuffer  and our vertex shader as input: And the  Model  needs to be updated to take the instanced attributes and  instanceCount : Our  onRender  needs an update to perform the transform feedback and pass the transformed rotation buffer to the  Model : If all went well, you should see 4 rotating cubes.

This will involve using luma.gl's WebGL wrappers to do the drawing instead of the higher-level  Model . We'll start from the  high-level app  we created. First we need to install the  shadertools  module so we can compose shaders without the  Model  class: Now we can update the imports: Most of the initialization is similar, but we'll replace the creation of  Model  with its individual parts: shader composition, a vertex array, and a program. Shader composition is handled by  assembleShaders We can then use the assembled shaders to create a  Program : The attributes for the draw are managed by a  VertexArray : The  VertexArray  takes the  program  as an argument to infer attribute parameters. The  vertexArray  and  program  are required for drawing, so we'll return them from  onInitialize , and then use them in  onRender : The scene should be identical to the one draw with the high-level API.

To accomplish this, we'll use one of  luma.gl 's built-in shader modules for the first time. To start, we'll add the  phongLighting  module from  @luma.gl/shadertools  to our imports: The  phongLighting  shader module adds functions to our fragment shader to facilitate lighting calculations. We'll modify our shaders to perform our lighting calculations in the following ways: We'll input the surface  normals  as an attribute. We'll pass the world positions and normals to the fragment shader in  varying s We'll call  lighting_getLightColor , which will be added to our fragment shader by the  phongLighting  module, to calculate the final fragment color. Our  onInitialize  method needs a few significant updates: We're splitting the model matrix out on its own so we can use it in our shaders to transform the positions and normals for the lighting calculations. The biggest change, however, is the  moduleSettings  parameter we're passing to our  Model  constructor.  moduleSettings  are passed on to shader modules to help them set up uniforms. In this case, we're passing some material and light properties that  phongLighting  uses to perform its lighting calculations in  lighting_getLightColor . Our  onRender  doesn't change much except to set up the model matrix separately from the MVP matrix and pass it as a uniform: If all went well, you should see a scene almost identical to the one from the  previous tutorial  but with some white light reflecting off the cube.

To start, we'll modify our imports: Our shaders and modules will be the same as before: We then create two programs by first assembling our base shaders with the desired modules and shader hooks, and then using them to create WebGL program objects: With our final programs created, we can draw as we would in any other WebGL application.

When using  Buffer s as input to shader programs, applications must tell WebGL how the data in the buffer is formatted, so that the GPU knows how to access buffers' memory. To enable applications to specify how the buffer memory should be accessed, luma.gl APIs that set attribute buffers accept buffer \"accessor objects\". Accessor Object Fields This is an overview of the object accessor fields that are available to applications to define format descriptions. These objects can contain the following fields, this is an excerpt from  Accessor . Property Auto Deduced Default Comment buffer No An accessor can optionally reference a specific buffer. Multiple accessors can point to the same buffer, providing different views or \"slices\" of the buffer's memory. offset No 0 Byte offset to start of data in buffer stride No 0 Extra bytes between each successive data element type Yes GL.FLOAT Low level data type ( GL.BYTE ,  GL.SHORT , ...) size Yes 1 Components per element ( 1 - 4 ) divisor Yes 0 Enables/disables instancing normalize N/A false Normalize integers to  -1,1 , or  0,1  if unsigned integer N/A false Disable conversion of integer values to floats  WebGL 2 Combining Accessors with Buffers When setting attributes (e.g. using  Model.setProps({attributes: {attributeName: value, ...}})) , each attribute value needs to contain both a buffer (a handle to the raw data uploaded to the GPU) and an accessor (describing how that data should be accessed). luma.gl provides three methods to specify attribute values so that both a buffer and an accessor are provided: As a two-element array:  [buffer, accessor] . As an accessor, in which case the accessor object's  buffer  field should be set to the matching  Buffer . As a  Buffer , in which case the  Buffer  objects  accessor  field should be set to the mathing  Accessor . All three methods have their uses: the first option gives the applications full freedom to dynamically select combinations of buffers and accessors, the second option is often the natural choice when working with interleaved buffers (see below), and the last choice is often the most convenient when just setting up an ad-hoc buffer for immediate use, as the accessor can be stored directly on the buffer, avoiding the need to manage separate objects. Accessor Class vs Accessor Objects luma.gl provides the  Accessor  helper class to help you work with accessor objects. For instance, the  Accessor  class supports merging of partial accessor objects, see below. Note that it is not necessary to use the  Accessor  class, as plain old JavaScript objects with the appropriate fields are also accepted by the various APIs that accept accessors. Use the style that works best for your application. \"Partial\" Accessors luma.gl allows \"partial\" accessors to be created, and later combined. Usually many accessor fields can be left undefined (e.g. because defaults are sufficient, or because accessor auto-deduction has already deduced the information, see below). Partial accessors will be created automatically by  Program  when shaders are compiled and linked, and also by  Buffer  objects when they are created. Any application supplied accessors fields will then be merged in (override) these auto-deduceted fields, that can add any fine-tuning or override of parameters. Accessor Auto Deduction luma.gl attempts to \"auto deduce\" as much accessor information as it can, for instance luma.gl can extract fields like  type  and  size  after shaders have been compiled. This relieves applications from having to respecify the same thing multiple times. For instance if the application has already declared an attribute as  in vec2 size  in the vertex shader, it does not need to specify  size:2, type: GL.FLOAT  again in the accessor, when it sets the buffer in JavaScript, since this information will have been auto-deduced. In many cases, when buffers are not shared between attributes (i.e. interleaved) and default behavior is desired, luma.gl applications often do not need to specify any  Accessor  at all. Merging (Resolving) Accessors The  Accessor  API allows for accessors to be merged (or \"resolved\") into a new  Accessor . Accessor mmerging is mainly used internally in luma.gl to implement support for partial accessors and accessor auto deduction, but can be used by applications if necessary. Data Interleaving Using the stride  and  offset  fields in accessor objects, it is possible to interleave two arrays so that the first two elements of one array are next to each other, then the next two elements etc. For more information see the article about attributes. Using Different Size in Buffers and Shaders It is possible to use different size memory attributes than specified by the GLSL shader code, by specifying a different size in the accessor compared to the GLSL shader variable declaration. Extra components in the Buffer memory will be ignored, missing components will be filled in from  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) Be aware that the headless gl integration does not support this feature due to limitations in headless gl. glTF Format Accessors glTF formatted files . glTF files contain two JSON object arrays (\"bufferViews\" and \"accessors\") that describe how raw memory buffers are organized and should be interpreted. The  Accessor  and  Buffer  class APIs have intentionally been designed to be a close representation when converting \"accessors\" and \"bufferViews\" stored in glTF files. Each glTF  accessor  can be mapped to a luma.gl  Accessor  and each glTF  bufferView  can be mapped to a luma.gl  Buffer .

Most of this will be fairly similar to the  Hello Triangle  app. We'll start by setting up our imports and defining our base vertex and fragment shaders: We have two vertex and fragment shader pairs: one will move vertices to the left, the other moves vertices to the right. Both fragment shaders take an  HSV color  as input call a  color_hsv2rgb  to convert it to RGB. But  color_hsv2rgb  isn't defined anywhere, so these shaders will not compile as-is. We define  color_hsv2rgb  in a shader module: Shader modules are simply JavaScript objects that contain at least a name and some shader code. They can be defined to inject code into the vertex shader, the fragment shader or both. Our  colorModule  defines the  color_hsv2rgb  function used by our fragment shaders. It converts the HSV value to RGB and returns it. We're applying a shader module best practice of prefixing our function with the module name ( color_ ) to avoid name collisions. In the  onInitialize  method of our  AnimationLoop , we create two models with different vertex and fragment shader sources, but both including the our  colorModule . In  onRender , we simply draw both models: If all went well, a blue trangle and a red triangle should be drawn side-by-side on the canvas. See the live demo  here .

Transform feedback allows us to capture vertex shader results from one pass and use them in subsequent passes. It is a powerful tool that can be used to set up massively parrallelized animations or data transformations. Note that transform feedback can only be used with WebGL 2. In luma.gl, transform feedback is primarily exposed via the  Transform  class, which simplifies usage by managing input and output buffers. We'll demonstrate its usage by setting up a simple animation that runs completely on the GPU. To start, we'll modify our imports to include  Transform  from  @luma.gl/engine : Then we'll define our shaders, which we'll write in GLSL ES 3.0 since we're using WebGL 2: Internally, we'll be using two separate programs, one for transform feedback and the other for rendering, so we define shaders for both. By default, the  Transform  class will skip rasterization and doesn't require a fragment shader since transform feedback is an operation on vertex data. We define a vertex shader for a transform feedback pass that simply rotates each vertex by 2 degrees in the xy-plane. The rendering vertex and fragment shaders are identical to the ones used in the  Hello Triangle  tutorial aside from being written in GLSL ES 3.0. In  onInitialize , we create our  Transform  instance: We pass the vertex shader we defined, as well as the initial input buffer in the  sourceBuffers  property, which maps attribute names to buffers. The  feedbackMap  property maps input attributes to output varyings from the vertex shader. Internally it will create an output buffer of the same size as the input buffer into which transformed data will be written. Finally, we create a model instance to perform the rendering: We set up the  Model  similarly to how we've done in other tutorials, with the exception that the  position  attribute is backed by the  vPosition  output buffer created by the  Transform . Our  onRender  involves a few additional steps compared to what we've seen before: First, we run the transform feedback to write the rotated positions to the  vPosition  output buffer. We then bind the  Model 's  position  attribute to the  vPosition  output buffer from the last transform pass and draw. Finally, we swap the input and output buffers in the transform so that the newly rotated positions will be used as input for the next pass, allowing the animation to continue. If all went well, you should see a tri-color triangle rotating on the screen.

This allows you to later easily check in the debugger which object (which specific instance of that class) is involved in a stack trace. id s that you provide are also used by the built-in logging. Logging luma.gl has a logging mechanism. Set the global variable luma.log.level to 3 (can be done in the browser console at any time) and luma will print tables for uniforms and attributes providing information about their values and types before each render call. This can be extremely helpful for checking that shaders are getting valid inputs. Shader compilation errors luma.gl takes care to extract as much information as possible about shader compiler errors etc, and will throw exceptions with very detailed error strings when shaders fail to compile. luma.gl also injects and parses  glslify  \"shader names\", making it possible to name shaders inside the shader code, making it easier to identify which shader is involved when e.g shader parsing errors occur. Parameter Validation luma.gl runs checks on attributes and buffers when they are being set, catching many trivial errors such as setting uniforms to  undefined  or wrong type (scalar vs array etc). Buffers will also have their first values checked to ensure that they are not NaN. As an example, setting uniforms to illegal values now throws an exception containing a helpful error message including the name of the problematic uniform.

There are multiple techniques used in JavaScript. Choosing a dist folder When installed from npm, luma.gl and related libraries come with three separate  dist  sub folders. Folder mainField Description dist/es6 esnext The most compact distribution is with very few exceptions essentially untranspiled ES6/ES2015 code (via  babel-preset-env ). This is the smallest distribution, and is the best choice if you are only targeting modern \"evergreen\" browsers (e.g. not IE11 or older mobile devices). dist/esm module Same as  dist/es5 , except  export  and  import  statements are left untranspiled to enable tree shaking. The main reason to use this distribution is if your are targeting older browsers (e.g. IE11 or older mobile devices). dist/es5 main All code is transpiled into ES5 and exports/imports are transpiled into  commonjs  requires. The main reason to use this distribution is if your bundler does not support tree-shaking using  import / export  syntax. You will have to check the documentation of your particular bundler to see what configuration options are available: Webpack 2 and later will pick the  esm  distribution by default (the  module  main field) Webpack 4 allows you to choose the  esnext  distribution by specifying a new  resolve.mainFields  array in your application's webpack config. For other bundlers, please refer to the respective documentation to see if you can control which distribution to use. If not, expect the  es5  distribution to be used. About Tree-Shaking luma.gl is designed to fully leverage tree-shaking. Tree-shaking should be possible with any supporting browser but development has currentle focusing on enabling the webpack 4 + babel 7 combination which provides excellent results. Some things to be aware of when working with tree-shaking: At least in Webpack, tree shaking is done by the uglifier, which is typically only run as the very last step on production builds. This means that it is typically not possible to assess the benefits of tree shaking during development. The lack of tree-shaking during development makes it hard to make statements about bundle size impact of a library just from looking at bundle sizes of development builds or the size of the library's npm module. Our recommendation is to always measure impact on your actual production builds. Pay for What you Use Naturally, an application that uses all the functionality offered by a framework will benefit little from tree shaking, whereas a small app that only uses a few selected components should expect big savings. When we modularize luma.gl, we are less focused on the size of the entire library, and more on making sure that applications only pay for the features they actually use. Also we try to make the core set of functionality small. Bundle Size Numbers So, what kind of impact on bundle sizes should you expect when using luma.gl? When do you know if you have set up your bundler optimally. To help answer these questions, we provide some numbers you can compare against. luma.gl has scripts that measure the size of a minified bundle after each build, which allows us to provide comparison numbers between releases. This bundle imports the  Module  and  AnimationLoop  classes, which are the basic building blocks of most apps. es6-production 6.1 Bundle/Zip 6.0 Bundle/Zip es6-production 144KB / 42KB 181KB / 51KB esm-production 209KB / 49KB 281KB / 66KB es5-production 408KB / 88KB 422KB / 93KB es6-development 787KB / 123KB 926KB / 165KB esm-development 1048KB / 150KB 1167KB / 192KB es5-development 961KB / 142KB 1052KB / 182KB Numbers represent the minified bundle size of a minimal application, bundled with Webpack 4, which means that the  ES6  and ESM numbers benefit from tree shaking. The number in parenthesis are the compressed bundle sizes. This is an indication of the how much extra size will be added to your compressed app bundle if you import luma.gl. For the ES6 and ESM dists, apps that use more luma.gl classes and features will see an increase in bundle size. Future Work This is not the final word on luma.gl bundle size. More work is being done to reduce the size of luma.gl and we are confident that even as fture releases will have more functionality, we will be able to keep the library code from growing and, more importantly, make luma.gl even more \"tree shakeable\", with the intention that apps should only \"pay for what they use\". Remarks Optimizing for minified code  - Due to inclusion of sourcemaps etc, the bundle size impact of luma.gl tends to look more significant in development builds than in the final production builds. While reducing the size of the development libraries is also desirable, the current goal is to ensure the impact of adding luma.gl on the final, minified/uglified application bundle is as small as possible.

Development is most easily done by running the examples in development mode, e.g.: Any modifications made to the source or example code will cause the example to rebuild and the page to refresh, making quick iterations on code changes straightforward. Testing against the full website can be done by running  yarn start  in the the  website/ . This full website take longer to build but makes it easier to test against all examples. This can be helpful when making core changes to luma.gl. As with running the examples in development mode, a rebuild and page refresh will be triggered whenever source or website code is updated. Testing Testing is performed on Travis CI and using a precommit hook. Local testing is supported on these environments: yarn test  - runs tests under node using headless.gl and a headless Chrome instance (using  SwiftShader ). yarn test browser  - Tests in your browser, may be helpful to quickly debug test case failures since it autoreloads on changes and gives you full access to your browser's debugger. When adding new features, please add relevant unit tests to the  test/  directory in the relevant module. Helpful Hints To only run one test from the suite for debugging purposes, change a call to  test  in the relevant spec to  test.only . Remember to change this back before committing! If a test fails in  headless , but not in the browser, it's likely due to a difference in the contexts created (WebGL 1 versus 2), or the extensions available.

This allows developers to program directly against the WebGL API with some helpful polyfilling and state tracking. shadertools : A system for modularizing and composing GLSL shader code. debug : Tooling to aid in debugging. luma.gl  also exposes a  core  module that simply re-exports key parts of the other modules. This can be helpful to just get started without worrying too much about fine-grained control of dependencies.

Applications use transform feedback to data processing from CPU to GPU, where multiple parallel execution units will be used for processing. Data is handled in form of  Buffer  objects, i.e. data resides in the GPU memory. Transform Feedback operations write their output into  Buffer  instances. These buffers can then be directly set as attributes on  Model  or  VertexArray  for regular rendering operations. Buffers can be read back to the CPU, but this has a high performance penaltyh. Ideally, the application's logic can be designed so that CPU access is not required which avoids expensive CPU and GPU sync. To run a single transform feedback operation: Create a  Program  or a  Model  with varyings ( out  variables) declared in the vertex shader's GLSL code, and provide the names of these varyings to the  Program  constructor. Use  Program.draw()  or  Model.draw()  with a  transformFeedback  parameter. Model.transform()  is equivalent to  Model.draw()  but automatically turns off the fragment shader stage. Alternatively, the more powerful  Transform  class is preferable if you don't want to deal with setting up  Program  and  TransformFeedback  instances, or if intend to run a repeating, double buffered transform feedback loop. Usage Use case : Specify source and destination buffers. Create a  Transform  object by passing, vs (vertex shader), source buffer(s), varyings (output variable names in vertex shader) and destination buffers. Then call  run  to perform one transform feedback iteration. Use case : Create destination buffers automatically. Transform  can internally create destination buffers (i.e. feedback buffers), when  feedbackMap  is provided. Each destination buffer is created with same settings and layout as corresponding source buffer as per  feedbackMap . Use case : Multiple iterations using swap(). When  feedbackMap  is specified buffers can be swapped using a single call to  swap() , this is useful for cases like particle simulation, where output of one transform feedback iteration is piped as input to the next iteration. Use case : Update one or more buffers using update() method..

It addresses the lack of a module/import system in the GLSL language and allows you to import chunks of reusable shader code from modules into your shader source code, and organize your shader code in reusable modules. Enables you to import and \"inject\" prepackaged modules of shader code into your shaders. Allows you to package up reusable GLSL code as shader modules. Adds GPU detection and a measure of portability your shaders. Usage To add/inject existing modules into your shaders, just add the modules parameter to your  assembleShaders  call: To create a new shader module, you need to create a descriptor object. This object can be used as shader module directly: Structure of a Shader Module Shader Module Type A shader module is either: Generic  - a set of generic GLSL functions that can be included either in a fragment shader or a vertex shader (or both). The  fp64  module is a good example of this type of module. Functional  - Contains specific vertex and/or fragment shader \"chunks\", often set up so that the vertex shader part sets up a  varying  used by the fragment shader part. Shader Module Descriptor To define a new shader module, you create a descriptor object that brings together all the necessary pieces: Descriptor objects can define the following fields: name  ( String , Required) - The name of the shader module. vs  - (String | null) fs  - (String | null) getUniforms  JavaScript function that maps JavaScript parameter keys to uniforms used by this module uniforms  ( Object ) - a light alternative to  getUniforms , see below inject  ( Object ) - injections the module will make into shader hooks, see below dependencies  ( Array ) - a list of other shader modules that this module is dependent on deprecations  ( Array ) - a list of deprecated APIs. If  deprecations  is supplied,  assembleShaders  will scan GLSL source code for the deprecated constructs and issue a console warning if found. Each API is described in the following format: type :  uniform <type>  or  function old : name of the deprecated uniform/function new : name of the new uniform/function deprecated : whether the old API is still supported. GLSL Code The GLSL code for a shader module typically contains: a mix of uniform and varying declarations one or more GLSL function definitions getUniforms Each shader module provides a method to get a map of uniforms for the shader. This function will be called with two arguments: opts  - the module settings to update. This argument may not be provided when  getUniforms  is called to generate a set of default uniform values. context  - the uniforms generated by this module's dependencies. The function should return a JavaScript object with keys representing uniform names and values representing uniform values. The function should expect the shape of the dependency uniforms to vary based on what's passed in  opts . This behavior is intended because we only want to recalculate a uniform if the uniforms that it depends on are changed. An example is the  project  and  project64  modules in deck.gl. When  opts.viewport  is provided,  project64  will receive the updated projection matrix generated by the  project  module. If  opts.viewport  is empty, then the  project  module generates nothing and so should  project64 . uniforms If the uniforms of this module can be directly pulled from user settings, they may declaratively defined by a  uniforms  object: At runtime, this map will be used to generate the uniforms needed by the shaders. If either  strength  or  center  is present in the user's module settings, then the user's value will be used; otherwise, the default value in the original definition will be used. Each uniform definition may contain the following fields: type  ( String ) - one of  number ,  boolean ,  array  or  object value  - the default value of this uniform With  type: 'number' , the following additional fields may be added for validation: min  ( Number ) max  ( Number ) Note:  uniforms  is ignored if  getUniforms  is provided. inject A map of hook function signatures to either the injection code string, or an object containing the injection code and an  order  option indicating ordering within the hook function. See  assembleShaders  documentation for more information on shader hooks. For example: GLSL Versions Shader modules will undergo some basic text transformations in order to match the GLSL version of the shaders they are injected into. These transformations are generally limited to the naming of input variables, output variables and texture sampling functions. See  assembleShaders  documentation for more information.","headings":[{"value":"Shader Modules","depth":1},{"value":"Overview","depth":2},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Structure of a Shader Module","depth":2},{"value":"Shader Module Type","depth":3},{"value":"Shader Module Descriptor","depth":3},{"value":"GLSL Code","depth":3},{"value":"getUniforms","depth":3},{"value":"uniforms","depth":3},{"value":"inject","depth":2},{"value":"GLSL Versions","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/shader-modules","title":"Shader Modules"},{"excerpt":"Debug Warning: Debug contexts impose a significant performance penalty (due to waiting for the GPU after each WebGL call to check error codes) and should not be used in production builds. luma.gl is pre-integrated with the Khronos group's WebGL debug tools (the  WebGLDeveloperTools ) and can use these to \"instrument\"  WebGLRenderingContext s.

Accessors are used. The type of values, number of values per element, any offset and strides, etc. as well as some additional parameters relating to how the GPU should access buffer data (instance divisors, integer normalization etc). By using multiple  Accessor  instances, the application can defined different \"views\" of the data in a single buffer. Accessors are immutable by design. Once they have been created they cannot be changed. Accessors can be resolved (merged) into a new Accessor. This is useful since while some accessor properties can be extracted directly from a program's shaders (and some can be extracted when data is set to the buffer), some properties needs to be set by the application.

This memory can be accessed directly by the GPU and is used to store things like vertex data, pixel data retrieved from images or the framebuffer, etc. The  Buffer  class provides mechanism for allocating such memory, together with facilities for copying data to and from the GPU (usually via JavaScript typed arrays). For additional information, see  OpenGL Wiki . Usage Creating a generic buffer Creating an elements buffer Allocating memory in a buffer Allocating and initializing a buffer Updating a buffer Copying data between buffers (WebGL 2) Getting data from a buffer (WebGL 2) Members handle  :  WebGLBuffer Holds the underlying WebGL object reference. byteLength  : Number Number of bytes of allocated memory. bytesUsed  : Number Same as  byteLength  unless the  Buffer.reallocate  has been called with a value smaller than the actual length of the buffer. accessor  :  Accessor Holds an  Accessor  instance. By default it contains type information that is automatically deducted from the type of data used to initialize the buffer, but the application can store any  Accessor  it wants with the  Buffer . This can simplify handling of buffer related data in many basic use cases (e.g. when buffers are not shared by multiple attributes etc). Constructor Buffer(gl : WebGLRenderingContext, props : Object | TypedArray | Number) Creates a new  Buffer . Multiple signatures are supported: gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context target = ( GLenum , optional) - the type of buffer, see below. ...initOptions  ( Object ) - options passed on to  initialize . accessor  - options used to create the  accessor ...accessorOptions  (DEPRECATED) - options passed on to  setAccessor . Use  accessor  instead. gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context typedArray  - typed array with values that should be used to size and initialize the new GPU buffer. Short hand for  new Buffer({data: typedArray}) . gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context byteLength  - specifies the number of bytes that should be allocated (but not initialized). Short hand for  new Buffer({byteLength}) . The newly constructed buffer will either be a an \"element\" buffer used for storing vertex indices, or a \"generic\" buffer that can be used to store other things. To create an element buffer, specify  target: GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER . If target is not specified, it will be a generic buffer that can be used in a variety of situations. In WebGL 1, the default target is  GL.ARRAY_BUFFER  which will work as a \"generic\" (i.e. non-element) buffer. In WebGL 2, the default target is  GL.COPY_READ_BUFFER  which means the buffer can work either as a generic buffer and an element buffer. This will be determined when it is first used with (bound to) a specific target. From that point on, WebGL will consider it either as an element buffer or a generic buffer. Methods initialize(props : Object) : Buffer Allocates and optionally initializes buffer memory/data store (releasing any previously allocated memory). Also extracts characteristics of stored data, hints for vertex attribute. data  (ArrayBufferView) - contents byteLength  (Number) - the size of the buffer object's data store. usage = GL.STATIC_DRAW  (GLenum) - Allocation hint for GPU driver. accessor  (Object) - object with accessor props to be stored as accessor. ...accessorOptions  (DEPRECATED) - parameters passed to  setAccessor reallocate(byteLength : Number) : Buffer If necessary, increases buffer size to  byteLength . Does not decrease the buffer's size if already long enough. byteLength  (Number) - the minimum size of the buffer object's data store. Returns: true  - if reallocation happened (in which case any stored data was invalidated). false  - if the  Buffer  was already big enough in which case any uploaded data remains intact. subData({data , offset=, srcOffset=, length=}) : Buffer Updates part or all of a buffer's allocated memory. Buffer.subData({data, offset=, srcOffset=, length=}) data  ( ArrayBufferView ) - length is inferred unless provided offset = 0  - Offset into buffer srcOffset = 0  - WebGL 2: Offset into srcData length  - WebGL 2: Number of bytes to be copied copyData(options : Object) : Buffer (WebGL 2) Copies part of the data of another buffer into this buffer. The copy happens on the GPU and is expected to be efficient. Buffer.copyData({sourceBuffer, readOffset=, writeOffset=, size}) options.sourceBuffer  ( Buffer ) - the buffer to read data from. options.readOffset = 0  (GLint) - byte offset from which to start reading from the buffer. options.writeOffset = 0  (GLint) - byte offset from which to start writing to the buffer. options.size  (GLsizei) - byte count, specifying the size of the data to be copied. Note: readOffset ,  writeOffset  and  size  must all be greater than or equal to zero. readOffset + sizereadOffset + size  must not exceeed the size of the source buffer object writeOffset + sizewriteOffset + size  must not exceeed the size of the buffer bound to writeTarget. If the source and destination are the same buffer object, then the source and destination ranges must not overlap. getData() : TypedArray (WebGL 2) Reads data from buffer into an  ArrayBufferView  or  SharedArrayBuffer . Buffer.getData({dstData, srcByteOffset, srcOffset, length}) dstData = null  ( ArrayBufferView  |  SharedArrayBuffer  |  null ) - memory to which to write the buffer data. New ArrayBufferView allocated with correct type if not provided. srcByteOffset = 0  (GLintptr) - byte offset from which to start reading from the buffer. srcOffset = 0  (GLuint) - element index offset where to start reading the buffer. length = 0  (GLuint) Optional, Element count to be copied, optimal value calculated when not provided. Returns a typed array containing the data from the buffer (if  dstData  was supplied it will be returned, otherwise this will be a freshly allocated array). getElementCount( accessor : Accessor ) : Number Returns number of elements in the buffer. In a buffer created with Float32Array typed array, each float is an element and takes 4 bytes (or 32 bits). setAccessor(accessor : Accessor | Object) : Buffer Allows you to optionally describe the accessor properties of the data in the buffer. This does not affect the buffer itself, but if supplied can avoid having to supply this data again when you use this buffer as an attribute later (see  VertexArray.setAttributes ). For details on accessor props, see the documentation for the  Accessor  class. Types Usage Usage WebGL 2 WebGL 1 Description GL.STATIC_DRAW Yes Yes Buffer will be used often and not change often.

Buffer binding and unbinding is handled internal by luma.gl methods and applications typically do not need to bind buffers. To support use cases integrating with external libraries or raw webgl code, it is of course possible to \"manually\" bind and unbind luma.gl  Buffer  instances: WebGL 2 examples Remarks All instance methods in a buffer (unless they return some documented value) are chainable. While transferring memory between CPU and GPU takes some time, once the memory is available as a buffer on the GPU it can be very efficiently used as inputs and outputs by the GPU. Note that in WebGL, there are two types of buffers: \"element\" buffers. These can only store vertex attributes with indices (a.k.a \"elements\") and can only be used by binding them to the  GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER  before draw calls. \"generic\" buffers. These can be used interchangeably to store different types of data, including (non-index) vertex attributes.

While it is crucial for the operation of a program, its presence under WebGL 1 is dependent on an  extension  that is fairly common, but not universally available. In particular it is not available in headless gl which is essential for running tests under Node.js. Therefore, in basic WebGL environments where the  VertexArrayObject  is not supported, luma.gl ensures that one (\"fake\") instance of the  VertexArrayObject  class can still be obtained, emulating the default ( null  handle)  VertexArrayObject . This instance has the  isDefaultArray  flag set, and applications can adapt their behavior accordingly, while still using the same API to manage vertex attributes, albeit with a small performance loss. Since there is a considerable amount of work required to handle both cases, luma.gl also provides a higher level  VertexArray  class that works around these issues and provided additional conveniences. It is usually not necessary to create neither  VertexArrayObject  nor  VertexArray  instances in luma.gl applications. It is often simpler to just provides attributes directly to the  Model  class. Still, it can be useful to review this documentation to understand how attributes are handled by WebGL. For more information on WebGL  VertexArrayObject s, see the  OpenGL Wiki .

Apps can use the luma.gl feature detection system to determine if instanced rendering is available, though the extension is so ubiquitously supported that many apps just make the assumption:  instanced_arrays . An attribute is referred to as  instanced  if its divisor value is non-zero. The divisor modifies the rate at which vertex attributes advance when rendering multiple instances of primitives in a single draw call. If divisor is zero, the attribute at slot index advances once per vertex. If divisor is non-zero, the attribute advances once per divisor instances of the set(s) of vertices being rendered.","headings":[{"value":"VertexArrayObject","depth":1},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Methods","depth":2},{"value":"VertexArray(gl : WebGLRenderingContext, props : Object)","depth":3},{"value":"VertexArray.getDefaultArray() : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"initialize(props : Object) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"setConstant(values : Array) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"setBuffer(nameOrLocation, buffer : Buffer , accessor : Object) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"getParameter(pname, location) : *","depth":3},{"value":"Types, Constants, Enumarations","depth":2},{"value":"getParameter Constants","depth":3},{"value":"Attribute Accessors","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/webgl/vertex-array-object","title":"VertexArrayObject"},{"excerpt":"VertexArray The  VertexArray  class (like its lower level counterpart, the  VertexArrayObject ) manages an \"array\" of values (\"buffers\") that will be made available as input data to shaders during a draw call.

Methods initialize(props : Object) : VertexArray Reinitializes a  VertexArray . attributes = {}  ( Object ) - map of attributes, can be keyed by index or names, can be constants (small arrays),  Buffer , arrays or typed arrays of numbers, or attribute descriptors. elements = null  ( Buffer ) - optional buffer representing elements array (i.e. indices) program  - Transfers information on vertex attribute locations and types to this vertex array. setAttributes(attributes : Object) : VertexArray Sets named uniforms from a map. attributes  - ( object ) An object with key value pairs matching a buffer name and its value respectively. Attributes is an object with key-value pairs:  {nameOrLocation: value, ....} . nameOrLocation  - ( string|number ) The name of the attribute as declared in the shader, or the location specified by a layout qualifier in the shader. The name can contain an offset to the actual location in the format of  name__LOCATION_0 . This is useful for setting  mat  type attributes. See the section at the bottom for more details. value  - ( Buffer|Array|typed array ) An attribute value must be a  Buffer  or a typed array. Each value can be an a  Buffer , an  Array  starting with a  Buffer  or a typed array. Typed Array - Sets a constant value as if  .setConstant(value)  was called. Buffer  - Binds the atttribute to a buffer, using buffer's accessor data as if  .setBuffer(value)  was called. Array  - Binds the atttribute to a buffer, with extra accessor data overrides. Expects a two element array with  [buffer : Buffer, accessor : Object] . Binds the attribute to the buffer as if  .setBuffer(buffer, accessor)  was called. setConstant(value : Array  , accessor : Object ) : VertexArray Sets a constant value for a vertex attribute. When this  VertexArray  is used in a  Program.draw()  call, all Vertex Shader invocations will get the same value. VertexArray.setConstant(location, array); gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context location  ( GLuint ) - index of the attribute WebGL APIs:\n vertexAttrib4[u]{f,i}v setBuffer(nameOrLocation, buffer : Buffer  , accessor : Object ) : VertexArray Binds the specified attribute in this vertex array to the supplied buffer Set a location in vertex attributes array to a buffer, specifying its data layout and integer to float conversion and normalization flags setBuffer(location, buffer); \n setBuffer(location, buffer, {offset = 0, stride = 0, normalized = false, integer = false}); location  ( GLuint  |  String ) - index/ordinal number of the attribute buffer  ( WebGLBuffer | Buffer ) - WebGL buffer to set as value gl.vertexAttrib{I}Pointer ,  gl.vertexAttribDivisor setElementBuffer(buffer : Buffer  , accessor : Object ) : VertexArray Binds the supplied buffer as index buffer ( GL.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER ). Attribute Accessors When setting  Buffer  attributes, additional data can be provided to specify how the buffer should be accessed. This data can be stored directly on the  Buffer  accessor or supplied to  .setBuffer . target = buffer.target  ( GLuint , ) - which target to bind to size  ( GLuint ) - number of values (components) per element (1-4) type  ( GLuint ) - type of values (e.g. gl.FLOAT) normalized  ( boolean , false) - normalize integers to  -1,1  or  0,1 integer  ( boolean , false) -  WebGL 2  disable int-to-float conversion stride  ( GLuint , 0) - supports strided arrays offset  ( GLuint , 0) - supports strided arrays layout.normalized = false  (GLbool) - normalize integers to  -1,1 ,  0,1 layout.integer = false  (GLuint) - WebGL 2 only, disable int-to-float conv. divisor  - Sets the frequency divisor used for instanced rendering (instances that pass between updates of attribute). Usually simply set to 1 or 0 to enable/disable instanced rendering. 0 disables instancing, >=1 enables it. Notes about Integer Attributes The application can enable normalization by setting the  normalized  flag to  true  in the  setBuffer  call. WebGL 2  The application can disable integer to float conversion when running under WebGL 2, by setting the  integer  flag to  true . glVertexAttribIPointer  specifies  integer  data formats and locations of vertex attributes. Values are always left as integer values. Only accepts the integer types gl.BYTE, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, gl.SHORT, gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT, gl.INT, gl.UNSIGNED_INT Notes about Instanced Rendering About setting  divisor  in attributes: Instanced attributes requires WebGL 2 or a (widely supported) WebGL 1 extension. Apps can use the luma.gl feature detection system to determine if instanced rendering is available, though the extension is so ubiquitously supported that many apps just make the assumption:  instanced_arrays . An attribute is referred to as  instanced  if its divisor value is non-zero. The divisor modifies the rate at which vertex attributes advance when rendering multiple instances of primitives in a single draw call. If divisor is zero, the attribute at slot index advances once per vertex. If divisor is non-zero, the attribute advances once per divisor instances of the set(s) of vertices being rendered. Notes about setting  mat  type attributes Setting a  mat  type in the shader requires to manually add an  offset  to the location. This can be done by using special name format  name__LOCATION_0 . This will add 0 to the  LOCATION  resulting in no change.  name__LOCATION_1  will add  1 . For example: if we have the following declaration in the shader: We should specify  matrix__LOCATION_0 ,  matrix__LOCATION_1 ,  matrix__LOCATION_2   and   matrix__LOCATION_3  as  vec4 .","headings":[{"value":"VertexArray","depth":1},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Constructor","depth":2},{"value":"VertexArray(gl : WebGLRenderingContext, props : Object)","depth":3},{"value":"Methods","depth":2},{"value":"initialize(props : Object) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"setAttributes(attributes : Object) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"setConstant(value : Array , accessor : Object) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"setBuffer(nameOrLocation, buffer : Buffer , accessor : Object) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"setElementBuffer(buffer : Buffer , accessor : Object) : VertexArray","depth":3},{"value":"Attribute Accessors","depth":2},{"value":"Notes about Integer Attributes","depth":2},{"value":"Notes about Instanced Rendering","depth":2},{"value":"Notes about setting mat type attributes","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/webgl/vertex-array","title":"VertexArray"},{"excerpt":"Texture A  Texture  is a WebGL object that contains one or more images that all have the same image format. Shaders can read from textures (through a sampler uniform) and they can be set up as render targets (by attaching them to a framebuffer). Note: This section describes the  Texture  base class that implements functionality common to all four types of WebGL: Texture2D  - Contains a \"normal\" image texture TextureCube  - Holds 6 textures representing sides of a cube. Texture3D  (WebGL 2) - Holds a \"stack\" of textures which enables 3D interpolation. For more details see  OpenGL Wiki . Note that textures have a lot of optional capabilities made available by extensions, see the Limits section below. Usage For additional usage examples,  Texture  inherits from  Resource . Configuring a Texture Using Textures Members A number of read only accessors are available: width  - width of one face of the cube map height  - height of one face of the cube map format  - internal format of the face textures border  - Always 0. type  - type used to create face textures dataFormat  - data format used to create face textures. offset  - offset used to create face textures. Always 0, unless specified using WebGL 2 buffer constructor. handle  - The underlying WebGL object. id  - An identifying string that is intended to help debugging. Sampler parameters can be accessed using  Texture.getParameter , e.g: texture.getParameter(GL.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER); Methods constructor(gl : WebGLRenderingContext, props : Object) The texture class cannot be constructed directly. It is a base class that provides common methods the the concrete texture classes. Texture2D , TextureCube  and Texture3D . The constructors for these classes should be used to create textures. They constructors all take common parameters, many of which are specified in this document. Pixel store parameters are described in  State Management . resize(options : Object) : Texture2D Call to resize a texture. If size has changed, reinitializes texture with current format. Note: calling  resize  clears image and mipmaps. width  (GLint) - width to resize to. height  (GLint) - height to resize to. mipmaps  (bool) - turn on/off mipmapping. default  false . generateMipmap() : Texture2D Call to regenerate mipmaps after modifying texture(s) WebGL References  gl.generateMipmap setImageData(options : Object) : Texture2D Allocates storage and sets image data data  ( * ) - Image data.

Type Description null A texture will be created with the appropriate format, size and width. Bytes will be \"uninitialized\". typed array Bytes will be interpreted according to format/type parameters and pixel store parameters. Buffer  or  WebGLBuffer  ( WebGL 2 ) Bytes will be interpreted according to format/type parameters and pixel store parameters. Image  ( HTMLImageElement ) image will be used to fill the texture. width and height will be deduced. Video  ( HTMLVideoElement ) video will be used to continously update the texture. width and height will be deduced. Canvas  ( HTMLCanvasElement ) canvas will be used to fill the texture. width and height will be deduced. ImageData canvas.getImageData()  - Used to fill the texture. width and height will be deduced. Texture Formats Internal Format If an application wants to store the texture at a certain resolution or in a certain format, it can request the resolution and format with  internalFormat . WebGL will choose an internal representation with least the internal component sizes, and exactly the component types shown for that format, although it may not match exactly. WebGL 2 adds sized internal formats which enables the application to request\nspecific components sizes and types (float and integer formats). While sized formats offer more control, unsized formats do give the GPU freedom to select the most performant internal representation. Unsized Internal Format Components Description GL.RGB 3 sampler reads the red, green and blue components, alpha is 1.0 GL.RGBA 4 Red, green, blue and alpha components are sampled from the color buffer. GL.LUMINANCE 1 Each color contains a single luminance value. When sampled, rgb are all set to this luminance, alpha is 1.0. GL.LUMINANCE_ALPHA 2 Each component is a luminance/alpha double. When sampled, rgb are all set to luminance, alpha from component. GL.ALPHA 1 Discards the red, green and blue components and reads the alpha component.

Remarks Textures can be supplied as uniforms to shaders that can sample them using texture coordinates and color pixels accordingly. Parameters that affect texture sampling can be set on textures or sampler objects. Textures can be created from a number of different sources, including typed arrays, HTML Images, HTML Canvases, HTML Videos and WebGLBuffers (WebGL 2).

For example: transpileToGLSL100 : force transpilation to GLSL ES 1.0 (see below) Returns: vs  - the resolved vertex shader fs  - the resolved fragment shader getUniforms  - a combined  getUniforms  function covering all modules. moduleMap  - a map with all resolved modules, keyed by name Shader Hooks and Module Injections Shader hooks and module injections are a system that allows for shader to be written in a generic manner, with behaviour modified when modules are included. For example if we define a shader hook as  fs:MY_HOOK_FUNCTION(inout vec4 color) ,  assembleShader  will inject the following function automatically into our fragment shader: We can the write our fragment shader as follows: By default, the hook function is a no-op, so this doesn't do anything. However, if we add a module injection like the following: And pass the  picking  module to  assembledShaders , the hook function will be updated as follows: The hook function now changes the color from white to red. Constants and Values Predefined Injection Hooks Key Shader Description vs:#decl Vertex Inject at top of shader (declarations) vs:#main-start Vertex Injected at the very beginning of main function vs:#main-end Vertex Injected at the very end of main function fs:#decl Fragment Inject at top of shader (declarations) fs:#main-start Fragment Injected at the very beginning of main function fs:#main-end Fragment Injected at the very end of main function NOTE : Injections assume that the  main  function appears last in a shader. Usage Injection Map assembleShaders  (and  Model  constructor) will take an  inject  argument that contains a map of: keys indicating hooks (predefined or functions) values representing code to be injected. This can be either a simple string or an object containing the  injection  string and an  order  indicating its priority. Examples: Transpilation If the  transpileToGLSL100  option is used,  assembleShaders  will attempt to transpile shaders to GLSL ES 1.0. This is a limited text replacement and requires that certain conventions be followed: Statements are written one per line. Only one fragment shader output is supported. GLSL 3.0-only features, such as 3D textures are not supported. Text transformations are performed according to the following tables: Vertex Shaders 3.00 ES 1.00 ES Comment in attribute out varying Fragment Shaders 3.00 ES 1.00 ES Comment in varying out vec4 <varName> gl_FragColor <varName>  declaration is removed and usage in the code are replaced with  gl_FragColor texture texture2D texture  will be replaced with  texture2D  to ensure 1.00 code is correct.

In particular, supports picking a specific instance in an instanced draw call. Color based picking lets the application draw a primitive with a color that can later be used to index this specific primitive. Usage In your vertex shader, your inform the picking module what object we are currently rendering by supplying a picking color, perhaps from an attribute. In your fragment shader, you simply apply (call) the  picking_filterPickingColor  filter function at the very end of the shader. This will return the normal color, or the highlight color, or the picking color, as appropriate. If you would like to apply the highlight color to the currently selected element call  picking_filterHighlightColor  before calling  picking_filterPickingColor . You can also apply other filters on the non-picking color (vertex or highlight color) by placing those instruction between these two function calls. JavaScript Functions getUniforms getUniforms  returns an object with key/value pairs representing the uniforms that the  picking  module shaders need. getUniforms({pickingActive, ...}) pickingActive = false  ( boolean ) - Renders the picking colors instead of the normal colors. Normally only used with an off-screen framebuffer during picking. pickingSelectedColor = null  ( array|null ) - The picking color of the selected (highlighted) object. pickingHighlightColor =  [0, 255, 255, 255]  ( array ) - Color used to highlight the currently selected object. pickingAttribute = false  ( boolean ) - Renders a color that encodes an attribute value. Normally only used with an off-screen framebuffer during picking. Vertex Shader Functions picking_setPickingColor Sets the color that will be returned by the fragment shader if color based picking is enabled. Typically set from a  pickingColor  uniform or a  pickingColors  attribute (e.g. when using instanced rendering, to identify the actual instance that was picked). void picking_setPickingColor(vec3 pickingColor) picking_setPickingAttribute Sets the attribute value that needs to be picked. void picking_setPickingAttribute(float value) \n void picking_setPickingAttribute(vec2 value) \n void picking_setPickingAttribute(vec3 value) Fragment Shader Functions picking_filterPickingColor If picking active, returns the current vertex's picking color set by  picking_setPickingColor , otherwise returns its argument unmodified. vec4 picking_filterPickingColor(vec4 color) picking_filterHighlightColor Returns picking highlight color if the pixel belongs to currently selected model, otherwise returns its argument unmodified. vec4 picking_filterHighlightColor(vec4 color) Remarks It is strongly recommended that  picking_filterPickingColor  is called last in a fragment shader, as the picking color (returned when picking is enabled) must not be modified in any way (and alpha must remain 1) or picking results will not be correct.","headings":[{"value":"Core Shader Modules","depth":1},{"value":"picking","depth":2},{"value":"Usage","depth":3},{"value":"JavaScript Functions","depth":3},{"value":"getUniforms","depth":4},{"value":"Vertex Shader Functions","depth":3},{"value":"picking_setPickingColor","depth":4},{"value":"picking_setPickingAttribute","depth":4},{"value":"Fragment Shader Functions","depth":3},{"value":"picking_filterPickingColor","depth":4},{"value":"picking_filterHighlightColor","depth":4},{"value":"Remarks","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/shadertools/core-shader-modules","title":"Core Shader Modules"},{"excerpt":"Feature Checking Provides WebGL feature detection. WebGL capabilities can vary quite dramatically between browsers (from minimal WebGL 1 (e.g. headless-gl) to WebGL 1 with dozens of extensions to full WebGL 2, which also has a growing number of extensions). Unfortunately, the raw WebGL API sometimes expose the same functionalities through APIs that are slightly different and not exactly compatible. To simplify detecting and working with conditionally available capabilities (or \"features\") luma.gl provides: A set of functions that enable you to check if the application is currently running on an environment that supports a certain feature (regardless of whether it is supported through e.g. WebGL 2 or a WebGL 1 extension). In addition, luma.gl's WebGL classes transparently use WebGL extensions or WebGL 2 APIs as appropriate, meaning that the amount of conditional logic in application code can be kept to a minimum. Once you have established that a capability exists, luma.gl offers you one unified way to use it. Usage Check if a feature is available (whether as a WebGL 1 or WebGL 2 extension or through WebGL 2) Another example of feature detection There are a few additional capability query functions sprinkled through the luma.gl API. In particular, WebGL 2 specific classes have an  isSupported  method that duplicates some of the queryies that can be made using the capability system Functions hasFeature Allows the app to query whether a capability is supported without being concerned about how it is being provided (WebGL 2, an extension etc) gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context capability ( String ) - capability name (can be a webgl extension name or a luma.gl  FEATURES  constant). hasFeatures Allows the app to query whether a capability is supported without being concerned about how it is being provided (WebGL 2, an extension etc) gl  ( WebGLRenderingContext ) - gl context feature ( String | String[] ) - capability name (can be a webgl extension name or a luma.gl  FEATURES  constant). getFeatures This function returns an object containing all available features. WebGL Feature Detection WebGL 2 Classes with some WebGL 1 support Note that luma has a few WebGL 2 classes that  can  be instantiated under WebGL 1 VertexAttributeObject . Can be instanitated under WebGL 1 if the commonly supported extension is available. Also, luma.gl treats the global vertex array as a \"default\" VertexArrayObject, so that can always be accessed. Query  objects use GPU timing extensions if available. They can always be created but obviously queries will fail if capabilities are not present. UniformBufferLayout  - this class does not create any WebGL resources, it just helps the application access memory in the layout format expected by WebGL 2 uniform buffers. VertexAttributeObject  and  Query  have a static  isSupported()  method that you can call instead of checking for WebGL 2. WebGL 2 Classes that only work in WebGL 2 A list of luma classes that can only be instantiated under WebGL 2: Texture3D  - e.g for volumetric rendering Texture2DArray  - an array of textures, e.g. a texture atlas Sampler  - holds a separate set of texture sampler parameters TransformFeedback  - holds a list of output buffers for shaders to write to. Sync  - Each of these classes has a static  isSupported()  method that you can call instead of checking for WebGL 2. WebGL 2-only Features A partial list of features that are only available in WebGL 2: Non-power-of-2 textures - non-POT textures can have mipmaps in WebGL 2 Sized texture formats - Integer based texture formats and attributes - Multi-Sampled renderbuffers - Guaranteed texture access in vertex shaders - WebGL 1 is not required to support this (although it often does) GLSL 3.00 textureSize  - query  size of texture  from within shaders texelFetch  - access textures by  pixel  coordinates (0-width, 0-height) instead of  texel  coordinates (0-1) inverse  and  transpose  Matrix operations available in GLSL loop restrictions removed Optional Feature Detection The WebGL standard comes with an elaborate \"extension\" system allowing applications to check for the availability of features beyond the base WebGL 1 and WebGL 2 standards. These extensions tend to be rather technical, plus they have to be used differently in WebGL 1 and WebGL 2, so luma provides a simplified feature detection system. Following table lists all the available features, and their support under WebGL 1 and WebGL 2 ,  NO  implies not supported, 'YES' implies supported and  *  implies supported through an extension.

The capability detection system works regardless of whether the app is running in a browser or in headless mode under Node.js. Naturally, given that queries to driver and GPU are typically expensive in WebGL, the capabilities system will cache any queries.","headings":[{"value":"Feature Checking","depth":1},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Functions","depth":2},{"value":"hasFeature","depth":3},{"value":"hasFeatures","depth":3},{"value":"getFeatures","depth":3},{"value":"WebGL Feature Detection","depth":2},{"value":"WebGL 2 Classes with some WebGL 1 support","depth":3},{"value":"WebGL 2 Classes that only work in WebGL 2","depth":3},{"value":"WebGL 2-only Features","depth":3},{"value":"GLSL 3.00","depth":3},{"value":"Optional Feature Detection","depth":3},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/webgl/context/feature-checking","title":"Feature Checking"},{"excerpt":"Effects Shader Modules Screen space effects packaged as reusable shader modules in  @luma.gl/shadertools  based on the  glfx library .

Default value is  0.5 . tiltShift Simulates the shallow depth of field normally encountered in close-up photography, which makes the scene seem much smaller than it actually is. This filter assumes the scene is relatively planar, in which case the part of the scene that is completely in focus can be described by a line (the intersection of the focal plane and the scene).

Any GL parameter can be queried or set using  getParameters  and  setParameters  (no need to keep track of what underlying WebGL calls are required), and luma.gl also provide  setting names  that allow the normal WebGL setter functions (like  gl.blendEquation  or  gl.clearColor ) to be specified as keys in a  setParameters  call. In addition, state queries are done towards cached values and are thus much faster than working directly with the WebGL API, where synchronous WebGL queries can be a performance bottleneck. The following functions are provided: getParameters  - Returns the values of some or all GL context parameters setParameters  - Sets a the value(s) of the specified GL context parameters resetParameters  - Resets all gl context parameters to default values Usage Set a global parameter value using a WebGL GLenum Set a global parameter value using a luma.gl setting function name Get all gl parameter values (values will be an object map keyed with parameter names) Set parameters temporarily for a function call (automatically restoring them after the call) Functions getParameters Gets the values of a gl context parameter. gl  {WebGLRenderingContext} - context values = {Object | GLenum[] | null} - parameters, either as keys in object or elements of array. Defaults to all parameters.\nReturns {Object} - object with keys and values corresponding to supplied parameter names and the current values of those parameters. setParameters Sets a number of parameters. gl  {WebGLRenderingContext} - context key  {String} - parameter names, (, either )luma.gl setting name or a GL parameter constants value  { } - parameter value\nReturns { } - \"normalized\" parameter value after assignment Note: If both luma.gl setting names and GL parameter constants representing the same value are submitted the results are undefined. value may be \"normalized\" (in case a short form is supported). In that case the normalized value is returned. resetParameters Resets all gl context parameters to default values. gl  {WebGLRenderingContext} - context\nReturns no value. Note that technically, resetting context parameters does not fully reset the context, as buffer binding, z buffer values etc are not reset. withParameters Executes a function after temporarily setting the parameters. Will restore the parameters to their previously value after the completion of the function, even if the function exits with an exception. gl  {WebGLRenderingContext} - context params  {Object} - any parameter names accepted by  setParameters Returns: the value returned by  func , if any.

A large part of the WebGL API is devoted to parameters. When reading, querying individual values using GL constants is the norm, and when writing, special purpose functions are provided for most parameters. luma.gl supports both forms for both reading and writing parameters. Reading values from WebGL can be very slow if it requires a GPU roundtrip. To get around this, luma.gl reads values once, caches them and tracks them as they are changed through luma functions. The cached values can get out of sync if the context is shared outside of luma.gl. luma.gl's state management enables \"conflict-free\" programming, so that even when setting global state, one part of the code does not need to worry about whether other parts are changing the global state. Note that to fully support the conflict-free model and detect changes done e.g. in other WebGL libraries, luma.gl needs to hook into the WebGL context to track state changes.","headings":[{"value":"Parameter Setting","depth":1},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Functions","depth":2},{"value":"getParameters","depth":3},{"value":"setParameters","depth":3},{"value":"resetParameters","depth":3},{"value":"withParameters","depth":3},{"value":"Parameters","depth":2},{"value":"Blending","depth":3},{"value":"Clear Color","depth":3},{"value":"Color Mask","depth":3},{"value":"Depth Test","depth":3},{"value":"Derivative Hints (WebGL 2 or extension)","depth":3},{"value":"Hints","depth":4},{"value":"Dithering","depth":3},{"value":"Face Culling","depth":3},{"value":"Cull Face Modes","depth":4},{"value":"Face orientation","depth":4},{"value":"MipmapHint","depth":3},{"value":"Mipmap Hints","depth":4},{"value":"LineWidth","depth":3},{"value":"PolygonOffset","depth":3},{"value":"Rasterization (WebGL 2)","depth":3},{"value":"Sampling","depth":3},{"value":"Scissor Test","depth":3},{"value":"Stencil Test","depth":3},{"value":"Stencil Test Functions","depth":4},{"value":"Stencil Operations","depth":4},{"value":"Viewport","depth":2},{"value":"Pixel Pack/Unpack Modes","depth":2},{"value":"Pixel Pack/Unpack Modes WebGL 2","depth":2},{"value":"Remarks","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/gltools/parameter-setting","title":"Parameter Setting"},{"excerpt":"ScenegraphNode The  ScenegraphNode  is a base class for objects in the luma.gl scene graph, such as  Model ,  Group  and  Camera .

Provides a number of commonly needed variables as part of the  context  object which is passed to  onRender  and  onFinalize  callbacks. Objects returned by  onInitialize  will be appended to  context  object hence available to  onRender  and  onFinalize . To avoid problems with page load timing, move context creation to the  onCreateContext  method. By default,  onRender  method manages resizing of canvas, viewport and framebuffer. Makes it easy to wait for the HTML page to load before creating a canvas and WebGL resources. References: WebGL Fundamentals  contains excellent information on the subtleties of the how the WebGL context's drawing buffer and the HTML canvas interact. When running in the browser, this class uses  requestAnimationFrame Usage Autocreates a canvas/context Use a canvas in the existing DOM through its HTML id Methods constructor(props : Object) props.onCreateContext = null  (callback) - function without parameters that returns a  WebGLRenderingContext . This callback will be called exactly once, after page load completes. props.onInitialize  (callback) - if supplied, will be called once after first  start()  has been called, after page load completes and a context has been created. props.onRender = null  (callback) - Called on every animation frame. props.onFinalize = null  (callback) - Called once when animation is stopped. Can be used to delete objects or free any resources created during  onInitialize . props.onError = null  (callback) - Called when an error is about to be thrown. props.autoResizeViewport = true  - If true, calls  gl.viewport(0, 0, gl.drawingBufferWidth, gl.drawingBufferHeight)  each frame before  onRender  is called. Set to false to control viewport size. props.autoResizeDrawingBuffer = true  - If true, checks the canvas size every frame and updates the drawing buffer size if needed. props.useDevicePixels  - Whether to use  window.devicePixelRatio  as a multiplier, e.g. in  autoResizeDrawingBuffer  etc. Refer to  Experimental API  section below for more use cases of this prop. props.gl = null  (WebGLContext) - If supplied, will render into this external context instead of creating a new one. props.glOptions = {}  (object) - Options to create the WebGLContext with.

See  createGLContext . stop() : AnimationLoop Stops the animation animationLoop.stop() waitForRender() : Promise Returns a promise which resolves in the next frame after rendering and the  onRender  callback have completed. redraw() : AnimationLoop Immediately invokes a redraw (call  onRender  with updated animation props). Only use if the canvas must be updated synchronously. setNeedsRedraw(reason : String) : AnimationLoop animationLoop.setNeedsRedraw(reason) reason  ( String ) - A human readable string giving a hint as to why redraw was needed (e.g. \"geometry changed\"). If set, the value will be provided as the  needsRedraw  field to the  onRender  callback. Notes: onRender  will be called for each animation frame regardless of whether this flag is set, and the redraw reason is automatically cleared. If called multiple times, the  reason  provided in the first call will be remembered.

Allows time produced for animations to be paused, played, etc. See  Timeline  documentation for more info. detachTimeline() Detach the currently attached timeline from the animation loop. toDataURL Returns returns a  Promise  that resolves to the data URL of the canvas once drawing operations are complete for the current frame. The data URL can be used as the  src  for an HTML image element. animationLoop.toDataURL() isContextLost() Returns the current state of the WebGL context used by the animation loop.

Any fields in the object that was returned by the  onInitialize  method. Frame timers The animation loop tracks GPU and CPU render time of each frame the in member properties  cpuTime  and  gpuTime . If  gpuTime  is set to  -1 , then the timing for the last frame was invalid and should not be used (this rare and might occur, for example, if the GPU was throttled mid-frame). Experimental API ( useDevicePixels ) useDevicePixels  can accept a custom ratio (Number), instead of  true  or  false . This allows rendering to a much smaller or higher resolutions. When using high value (usually more than device pixel ratio), it is possible it can get clamped down, this happens due to system memory limitation, in such cases a warning will be logged to the browser console. For additional details check device pixels  document . Remarks You can instantiate multiple  AnimationLoop  classes in parallel, rendering into the same or different  WebGLRenderingContext s. Works both in browser and under Node.js. All  AnimationLoop  methods can be chained. Postpones context creation until the page (i.e. all HTML) has been loaded.

The  ProgramManager  will return the requested program, creating it the first time, and re-using a cached version if it is requested more than once. It also allows for the definition of hook functions and module code injections to be inserted into shaders. Usage Methods get(opts : Object) : Program Get a program that fits the parameters provided.

Applications can use this class to move data processing from CPU to GPU, where multiple parallel execution units will be used for processing. Data is handled in form of  Buffer  objects, i.e. data resides in the GPU memory. Output of this class can directly set as attributes on  Model  or  VertexArray  for regular rendering operations, CPU access is not required hence avoids expensive CPU and GPU sync. Transform  class creates and holds  Model  and  TransformFeedback  instances. This class is only supported when using  WebGL2RenderingContext . Use case : Specify source and destination buffers. Create a  Transform  object by passing, vs (vertex shader), source buffer(s), varyings (output variable names in vertex shader) and destination buffers. Then call  run  to perform one transform feedback iteration. Use case : Create destination buffers automatically. Transform  can internally create destination buffers (i.e. feedback buffers), when  feedbackMap  is provided. Each destination buffer is created with same settings and layout as corresponding source buffer as per  feedbackMap . Use case : Multiple iterations using swap(). When  feedbackMap  is specified buffers can be swapped using a single call to  swap() , this is useful for cases like particle simulation, where output of one transform feedback iteration is piped as input to the next iteration. Use case : Update one or more buffers using update() method.. Once  Transform  object is constructed and used, one or more source or destination buffers can be updated using  update . Use case : Reading source data from texture object (Experimental) In addition to reading data from Buffer objects, Transform can read from texture objects. Transform allows to access texture data in the same way as buffer data and internally generates required texture co-ordinates and sample instructions. Use case : Generating a texture object (Experimental) In addition to reading data from a texture object, Transform can generate texture object, by rendering data into it offline. Source data can be either buffer(s), texture(s) or any combination. Constructor Transform(gl : WebGL2RenderingContext, props: Object) Constructs a  Transform  object.

Returns a handle that can be used to reference the animation attachement. detachAnimation(handle : Number) Detach an animation object from the timeline.  handle  should be a value that was returned by  attachAnimation . update(globalTime : Number) Expected to be called once per frame, with whatever is considered the \"system time\". Required for  play  and  pause  to work properly.","headings":[{"value":"Timeline","depth":1},{"value":"Parallel Times","depth":2},{"value":"Usage","depth":2},{"value":"Methods","depth":2},{"value":"addChannel(props: Object) : Number","depth":3},{"value":"removeChannel(handle : Number)","depth":3},{"value":"isFinished(handle : Number) : Boolean","depth":3},{"value":"getTime(handle : Number) : Number","depth":3},{"value":"setTime(time : Number)","depth":3},{"value":"play","depth":3},{"value":"pause","depth":3},{"value":"reset","depth":3},{"value":"attachAnimation(animation: Object, channelHandle : Number) : Number","depth":3},{"value":"detachAnimation(handle : Number)","depth":3},{"value":"update(globalTime : Number)","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/api-reference/engine/animation/timeline","title":"Timeline"},{"excerpt":"@luma.gl/experimental Code in this module represents early-stage experiments and are not considered officially supported parts of the API.

They are independent of the luma.gl API and of each other, and could possibly be of generic interest for other webgl programs or frameworks that don't want to use luma.gl itself. Since all luma.gl code is MIT licensed you are of course welcome to copy these into your projects should you find them helpful. Canvas Management The canvas manages the default drawing buffer including the size of the default drawing buffer, so the canvas typically needs to be updated when the window resizes getPageLoadPromise Returns a promise that resolves when the page's HTML has loaded (meaning that any canvas specified in the HTML can now be queried by id). createCanvas Programatically creates a canvas element with a certain size and id, and inserts it into the documents body once the page is loaded (see  getPageLoadPromise ). createContext Gives a controlled interface to create a WebGL1 or WebGL2 context from a canvas. GLSL Error Parser formatGLSLError A formatter for parsing errors and warnings from the GLSL compiler. see  parseGLSLError . errLog  (String) - error log (from  gl.getShaderInfoLog ) src  (String) - original shader source code shaderType  (Number) - shader type (GL constant)\nReturn (String) - Formatted string, has the error marked inline with src. parseGLSLError A parse for GLSL compiler error logs. Note that the format of the error logs generated by the GLSL compiler is defined the WebGL spec, so it is possible to portably parse these logs. This function formats each GLSL shader compiler error or warning and generates text showing the source code around the error with marks pointing out where the issue was encountered. errLog  (String) - error log (from  gl.getShaderInfoLog ) src  (String) - original shader source code shaderType  (Number) - shader type (GL constant)\nReturn (object) - with  shaderName ,  errors  and  warnings  fields (all strings). WebGL Constants GL (namespace) All WebGL2 and extension constants exported as a single namespace  GL . Allows constants to be referenced without tracking which version of WebGL or what extensions are available. getKeyValue Resolves a WebGL enumeration  name  (returns itself if already a number) getKeyValue(gl, name) gl  (WebGLRenderingContext) - gl context name  (String) getKeyValue Returns a key that matches the number. getKey(gl, value) gl  (WebGLRenderingContext) - gl context","headings":[{"value":"@luma.gl/webgl","depth":1},{"value":"webgl-utils","depth":1},{"value":"Canvas Management","depth":2},{"value":"getPageLoadPromise","depth":2},{"value":"createCanvas","depth":3},{"value":"createContext","depth":3},{"value":"GLSL Error Parser","depth":2},{"value":"formatGLSLError","depth":3},{"value":"parseGLSLError","depth":3},{"value":"WebGL Constants","depth":2},{"value":"GL (namespace)","depth":3},{"value":"getKeyValue","depth":3},{"value":"getKeyValue","depth":3}],"slug":"modules/webgl","title":"@luma.gl/webgl"},{"excerpt":"@luma.gl/test-utils Client-side utility for browser-based WebGL render tests.
