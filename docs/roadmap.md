# Roadmap

Interested in what is coming down the road? We are trying to make the luma.gl roadmap as public as possible.

We share information about the direction of luma.gl in the following ways:

* **[RFCs](https://github.com/uber/luma.gl/tree/master/dev-docs/RFCs)** - RFCs are technical writeups that describe proposed features in upcoming releases.
* **[Roadmap Document](https://luma.gl/#/documentation/overview/roadmap)** - (this document) A high-level summary of our current direction for future releases.
* **[Blog](https://medium.com/@vis.gl)** - We use the vis.gl blog to share information about what we are doing.
* **[Github Issues](https://github.com/uber/luma.gl/issues)** - The traditional way to start or join a discussion.


## luma.gl v.Next

These are some of the main priorities for coming releases:

* **Better GPGPU Support** - Many stones are still left unturned here. API additions, shader testing support, shader module system enhancements, new shader modules.
* **Better WebGL2 Support** - Expect better performance, and new features for WebGL2 capable browsers.
* **Visual Effects** - Shadows, blur, postprocessing etc. This continues to be strong goal that we intend to make progress on.
* **Animations** - Animations of uniforms and of entire attributes.
* **Loaders** - Better loading support, probably glTF subset.
* **Code Size** - We are continously overhauling the code and build processes to reduce the size and maximize support for tree-shaking bundlers.
* **Shadertools Breakout?** - luma.gl's shader module system could be independently useful in any WebGL applications, so it could make sense to publish this as an independent module.
