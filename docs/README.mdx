## Highlights

luma.gl is a modern GPU toolkit for the Web, created to facilitate processing and visualization of big data on GPUs, that offers:

- A "close-to-the-metal" API for working with GPUs in TypeScript and JavaScript.
- Offers WebGPU, WebGL2 and WebGL backends.
- A minimal set of engine-level classes such as `Model`, `Transform` and `AnimationLoop` and basic scenegraph support.
- glTF support.
- A shader management system supporting shader modules, dependencies, injection, transpilation etc.
- Pre-optimized shader modules for compute, visual effects and post processing.

Unlike some other GPU frameworks, luma.gl does not include support for prerequisites such math and data loading. Instead luma.gl integrates seamlessly with dedicated companion framworks such as:

- [loaders.gl](https://loaders.gl) - wide range of 3D and geospatial data format standards.
- [math.gl](https://uber-web.github.io/math.gl/docs) - a variety of high precision geospatial and 3D math logic.

luma.gl is intended to be a foundation on top of which to build higher-level GPU frameworks. The primary example is

- [deck.gl](https://deck.gl) - geospatial GPU visualization and compute via a high-performance functional programming API.

## Philosophy

Rather than providing common higher level 3D engine type abstractions 
that shield the user from the details of how the GPU works, 
luma.gl is designed to let developers focus on GPU programming and
work directly with shaders and GPU data structures, offering APIs that are 
closely aligned with the WebGPU and WebGL APIs. 

For more information, refer to [luma.gl API philosophy](/docs/api-guide/background/api-design).

## Support

luma.gl supports recent versions of the most commonly used evergreen browsers (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

- Mobile browsers should be supported (assuming the mobile browser is an updated evergreen browser).
- Pre-chrome Edge is not officially supported, and IE11 is absolutely not supported.
- Running on top of software emulated GPUs is possible but known to have issues.
- Running in virtual machines etc may or may not be possible but is not officially supported.
- Running under Node.js may be possible if your Node.js environment can create WebGPU or WebGL contexts. Note that additional work may be required to load images into textures etc.

Most luma.gl development is done on desktop Chrome on MacBooks.
In case you think you have found an issue and want to check if it is specific to your environment,
it could be worth testing if you can reproduce your issue on Chrome before you report the bug.

If you have a confirmed bug that affects a supported environment, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/visgl/luma.gl/issues). 
However, if you are not yet sure, please help us keep issue noise down and start in the [discussions](https://github.com/visgl/luma.gl/discussions).
If you can provide a fix, you are welcome to open a pull request. It often makes sense to discuss before surprising maintainers with a big PR.

## History

luma.gl was originally created at Uber in 2015 as an open source project to support deck.gl. 

- 2022: luma.gl was accepted into the OpenJS foundation together with the vis.gl framework stack.
- 2019: Uber put luma.gl under open governance in the Linux Foundation.
- 2015: luma.gl started out as a fork of the [PhiloGL](https://github.com/senchalabs/philogl) WebGL library.

## Roadmap

luma.gl keeps evolving based on the needs of vis.gl frameworks and applications.
We share information about the direction of luma.gl in the following ways:

- **[RFCs](https://github.com/visgl/luma.gl/tree/master/dev-docs/RFCs)** - RFCs are technical writeups that describe proposed features in upcoming releases.
- **[Roadmap Document](https://luma.gl/#/documentation/overview/roadmap)** - (this document) A high-level summary of our current direction for future releases.
- **[Blog](https://medium.com/@vis.gl)** - We use the vis.gl blog to share information about what we are doing.
- **[Github Issues](https://github.com/visgl/luma.gl/issues)** - The traditional way to start or join a discussion.
