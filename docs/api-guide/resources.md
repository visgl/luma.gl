# GPU Resources

GPU resources come in a few different flavors

- Resources that represent actual memory uploaded to the GPU are `Buffer` and `Texture`. 
- Resources that hold executable GPU code, such as `Shader`, `Renderpipeline` and `ComputePipeline`.
- Other GPU resources tend to hold validated settings or state (usually these are GPU driver objects rather)

## Creating GPU Resources

The [`Device`](../api-reference/device) class provides methods for creating GPU resources

luma.gl provides a consistent API

| Resource creation method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `device.createBuffer(props: BufferProps | ArrayBuffer | ArrayBufferView): Buffer` | Create a buffer, Deduces `indexType` if usage. |
| `device.createTexture(props: TextureProps | Promise<TextureData> | string): Texture` | Create a  [`Texture`](./resources/texture). |
| `device.createSampler(props: SamplerProps): Sampler` | Create a [`Sampler`](./resources/sampler). |
| `device.createFramebuffer(props: FramebufferProps): Framebuffer` | Create a [`Framebuffer`](./resources/framebuffer). |
| `device.createShader(props: ShaderProps): Shader` | Create a [`Shader`](./resources/shader). |
| `device.createRenderPipeline(props: RenderPipelineProps): RenderPipeline` | Create a [`RenderPipeline`](./resources/render-pipeline) (aka program) |
| `device.createComputePipeline(props: ComputePipelineProps): ComputePipeline` | Create a [`ComputePipeline`](./resources/compute-pipeline) (aka program) |
| `beginRenderPass(props: RenderPassProps): RenderPass` | Create a [`RenderPass`](./resources/render-pass). |
| `beginComputePass(props?: ComputePassProps): ComputePass` | Create a [`ComputePass`](./resources/compute-pass) which can be used to bind data and run compute operations using compute pipelines. |
| `getDefaultRenderPass(): RenderPass` | A default `RenderPass` is provided for applications that don't need to create multiple or specially configured render passes. |
