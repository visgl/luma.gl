# Scenegraphs

The luma.gl engine provides a set of Scenegraph classes to organize `Model`s into a hierarchy.

Note that these classes are used by the `@luma.gl/gltf` module, which can transform a glTF file into a luma.gl Scenegraph.

But Scenegraphs can also be created programmatically by applications.
