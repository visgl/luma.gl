## Shader Syntax Highlighting

For practical reasons, luma.gl stores GLSL and WGSL shaders inline in strings, rather than as separate files.
A major drawback with this approach is the lack of syntax highlighting.

If you are using vscode, the 
[vscode-glsl-literal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boyswan.glsl-literal) and 
[vscode-wgsl-literal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ggsimm.wgsl-literal) 
vscode extensions can be used to regain syntax highlighting.
