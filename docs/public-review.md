# Public API Review 

## Open Governance

luma.gl is part of the vis.gl suite which is under open governance through the OpenJS Foundation.
Among other things, this means that vis.gl projects make efforts to share information about
ongoing and planned development, and ensures that there is a path for users and contributors
to influence the project.

## Why a Public Review

Due to the major overhaul of luma.gl required to fully embrace WebGPU, 
the luma.gl v9 API contains a significant number of breaking changes which will 
initially negatively affect the community.

This means that the project is setting aside some time to allow the community the 
opportunity to react to and comment on the API changes in the luma.gl v9 API. 

All input will be considered by maintainers and may or may not lead to API changes.

## What is under Review?

The luma.gl v9 API as described in this website, together with the source code on the luma.gl master branch.
alpha releases of the luma.gl v9 libraries, built from the luma.gl master branch, are being published,
and applications can now start installing and testing these libraries.

## Providing Feedback

Comments can be submitted on the luma.gl 
[GitHub discussions board](https://github.com/visgl/luma.gl/discussions). The deck.gl slack
also has a `#lumagl` channel.

## Timeline

The public review phase is currently expected to end on March 31, 2023. 
During this phase, the project will accept and consider comments and 
potentially make additional changes to the API. Shortly after the
public review phase ends, an official luma.gl v9 release will be made available.
