# Resource

`Resource` is the abstract base class for GPU objects created by a `Device`. It standardizes common fields such as identifiers and backend handles that are shared across buffers, textures, passes, and similar GPU resources.

## Types

### `ResourceProps`

`ResourceProps` define the shared configuration for all resources. These fields are inherited by every resource-specific props type.

| Property   | Type                        | Default       | Description |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `id?`      | `string`                    | autogenerated | Optional human-readable identifier. When omitted, a unique identifier is generated. |
| `handle?`  | `unknown`                   | `undefined`   | Existing backend handle to wrap instead of creating a new one. |
| `userData?`| `Record<string, unknown>`   | `undefined`   | Application data stored on the resource instance. |

## Members

- `id`: `string` – Debug-friendly identifier assigned at creation.
- `device`: `Device` – Device that owns the resource.
- `handle`: `unknown` – Backend object handle (WebGL object or WebGPU handle).
- `props`: `ResourceProps` – Initialization properties, normalized with defaults.
- `userData`: `Record<string, unknown>` – Application-defined metadata for the resource.

## Methods

- `destroy()` – Releases GPU memory and attached resources.
- `delete()` – Deprecated alias for `destroy()`.
- `attachResource(resource)` / `detachResource(resource)` – Manage owned child resources that are auto-destroyed with the parent.
- `destroyAttachedResource(resource)` / `destroyAttachedResources()` – Destroy owned resources.

Resource subclasses may add lifecycle hooks or tracking to align with the underlying WebGPU or WebGL implementation.
