/**
 * Minimal class that represents a "componentized" rendering life cycle
 * (resource construction, repeated rendering, resource destruction)
 *
 * @note A motivation for this class compared to the raw animation loop is
 * that it simplifies TypeScript code by allowing resources to be typed unconditionally
 * since they are allocated in the constructor rather than in onInitialized
 *
 * @note Introduced in luma.gl v9
 *
 * @example AnimationLoopTemplate is intended to be subclassed,
 * but the subclass should not be instantiated directly. Instead the subclass
 * (i.e. the constructor of the subclass) should be used
 * as an argument to create an AnimationLoop.
