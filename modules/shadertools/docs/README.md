# @luma.gl/shadertools

The shadertools module provides a framework-independent API for describing and composing shaders.

The current focus is on GLSL however the design should allow for WGSL support to eventually be included.

In particular,
- shadertools does not use WebGL or WebGPU API, meaning that it can be used with either (or both, in applications that support both).

## Features

- A GLSL Version Transpiler (transpiles between GLSL ES 4.50, GLSL ES 3.00, GLSL ES 1.00).
- API independent description for external shader entry points (attributes, varyings, uniforms, uniform blocks)
- Utilities for working with Uniform Buffers from JavaScript
- A Shader Module system allowing
- A props to uniforms mapping system
- A Shader Pass system allowing simple description and chaining of post processing effects.
- A selection of shader modules and shader passes
